        DEBUG STRUCTURE
*********************************/

/* This is the debug structure.  I guess it was intended to make some
   of the motion controller's internal variables visible from user
   space for debugging, but it has evolved into a monster.
   180K last time I checked - most of it (174K or so) is the traj
   planner queues... each entry is 720 bytes, and there are 210
   entries in the main queue.
   I'll figure it out eventually though.
   Low level things will be exported thru the HAL so they can be
   monitored with halscope.  High level things will remain here,
   and things that are internal will be moved to a private structure.
*/

/*! \todo FIXME - this struct is broken into two parts... at the top are
   structure members that I understand, and that are needed for emc2.
   Other structure members follow.  All the later ones need to be
   evaluated - either they move up, or they go away.
