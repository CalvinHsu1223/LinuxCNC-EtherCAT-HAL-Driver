HAL Component Page

Use this page to load extra HAL components 
    for custom HAL files

    The first selection is components that pncconf
        uses internally. You may configure pncconf to 
        load extra instances of the components for
        your custom HAL file. Select the number of
        instances your custom file will need, pncconf
        will add what it needs after them. Meaning
        if you need 2 and pncconf needs 1 pncconf will 
        load 3 instances and use the last one.

Custom Component Commands:
    This selection will allow you to load HAL 
        components that pncconf does not use.
        Add the loadrt or loadusr command, under the
        heading 'loading command'
        Add the addf command under the heading
        'Thread command'. By adding these commands
        to either the upper or lower boxes, you can
        choose the thread speed.
    The components will be added to the thread 
        between reading of inputs and writing of 
        outputs, in the order you write them.
