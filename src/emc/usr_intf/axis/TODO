Notes on support for machines with nontrivial kinematics:
$: toggle joint/world (also in menu -- machine or view?)
    cannot toggle from joint->world when all joints are not homed

joint numbers are displayed instead of axis names when in joint mode

machine/relative, actual/commanded, "touch off": disabled when in "joint" mode
 
start up in joint mode if kinematics is nontrivial / disable joint mode if
kinematics is trivial

Wishlist items
* Larger Buttons for "+" and "-"
* Display spindle speed in RPM
* Better "About AXIS" window.  (Example: in KWrite, there are tabs for
  "About", "Licence", "Translators" and other things)
* pick better Z-buffer extents using machine limits from inifile
* messages when paused (or about to pause) should offer the opportunity to
  unpause in the dialog
* make step button work from program beginning (if possible?)
* Way to show diameter of drills, width of cuts (poor-man's CSG preview)
* Way to turn off lines already plotted in live preview
* context menu on code area, options "copy", "start at this line"
* make the view follow the cone around
* more built-in help
* Perhaps cone size could be related to tool size
