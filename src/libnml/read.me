This directory contains the sources for a lean'n'mean replacement for
the NIST rcslib. Much of the original code is used, but without the
multitude of platform specific macros and sources. This is a linux
only implimentation with the ability to communicate with another 
computer running the NIST rcslib.

Initially, only shared memory buffers will be supported along with xdr and
raw data encoding.

The libnml is released under the GNU LGPL Version 2 license or later.
