To use gladevcp in a run in place environment just source scripts/rip-environment
and it will set all paths.

To install it system-wide you must link files from ./share/glade3/ 
to /usr/share/glade3 system folder.

When using gladevcp widgets in python programs you need to import
gladevcp.makepins.
