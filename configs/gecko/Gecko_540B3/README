Gecko_540B3 configuration for a 3 axis machine with X Y Z axes.

To use the charge pump on a G540 your base period must be
set to 50,000 or lower. Otherwise disable the charge pump feature.

The Stepconf Wizard XML file is included so you can open it up and
customize the configuration to suit your machine. After installing
this configuration move the Gecko_540B3.stepconf file to the configs
directory, then run the Stepconf Wizard and select Modify a configuration
already created with this program.

Run the latency test to determine your max jitter and enter that in
the Stepconf Wizard.

Set the axis limits, gearing for each axis.

Customize as needed to suit your machine.
