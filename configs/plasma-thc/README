These are three configs made for gantry style plasma cutting tables using stepper motors. There are seperate
configuration files for the MP1000A/B/C sold by CandCNC and a combo of Bob Campbells Breakout Combo and the THC300.
It should be easy to adjust these configurations to any breakout/thc made by SoundLogic, CandCNC and Bob Campbell.

Note that to have a seperate probe sensor for the Z axis (instead of using the home switch) the feedhold on the MP1000
is used for the probe switch signal. The MP1000 config also differs from standard by using shared home/limit switches
connected to the home terminals and ignoring the limit terminals.

If you have the MP1000 and want to use the serial interface you will need to install the pyserial module to enable serial
communications in python.

For testing I recommend the plasmatest.ngc file in the nc_files directory.

Also included in the config directory is a post processor to use with Sheetcam for making gcodes for this config.
