A configuration for the Universal PWM COntroller board from Pico
systems.  This configuration includes motion connections
and an IO set for handling estop within HAL.  The IO
configuration in univpwm_io.hal does not include signal
connections for other bridgeportio like signal handling.
This version takes advantage of the new UPC feature
of velocity estimation to provide smoother motion, especially
the functioning of the D term of the PID component.
