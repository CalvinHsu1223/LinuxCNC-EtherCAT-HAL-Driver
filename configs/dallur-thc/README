This config is for a plasma cutting machine with "stepper" control, along with ClassicLadder
connections to some of the LinuxCNC IO.  
It is based on the classicladder stepper sample config, but also includes a charge pump and 
a Torch Height Control system for Bob Cambells THC300 and CandCNC THC systems.
The stepper pinouts are for a standard breakout board/combo board as provided by Bob Campbell.
