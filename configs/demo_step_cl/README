This config is "stepper" with the addition of ClassicLadder
connections to some of the LinuxCNC IO.  The initial ladder program
includes several possible estop arrangements and a timed
lube coil.  The lube ladder includes a sense run that watches
lube level or lube pressure and warns of a lube condition failure.

This ladder integration with the HAL will allow you to expand
the IO interface to a minimill with spindle and tool changer
controls.
