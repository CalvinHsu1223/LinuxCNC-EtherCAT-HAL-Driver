The 'vismach' directory contains a number of configurations that
display a 3D model of the simulated machine.

These simulations are mostly intended to testing of complex kinematics
code by people who don't have those somewhat exotic machines.

All of these configurations work without realtime
and without hardware or drivers.

All of the simulations use the Axis GUI.  It is expected that these
configurations will need to be modified as work on joints vs. axes occurs.

Right now the possible choices are:

-- max5-triv.ini: Chris Radek's MaxNC which has been modified to have B and C
angular axes.  This version uses trivkins, so does not provide proper multi-axis behavior.

-- max5-kins.ini: Chris Radek's MaxNC which has been modified to have B and C
angular axes.  This version uses maxkins, and allows full 9-axis g-code.

-- hbm.ini: A large horizontal boring mill.  The quill is configured as the W axis.
