Sample config to show the usage of halui & pyvcp.

pyvcp = HAL Virtual Control Panel is a way to define virtual buttons & sliders,
they will be instantiated as buttons on a GUI, but will behave just like real
hardware. Check the Integrators Manual for additional details.

halui = HAL User Interface is a tool to allow LinuxCNC to be controlled by hardware
panels (knobs, switches, leds, etc).
