complex example with widget and variable persistence
----------------------------------------------------

This demonstrates the use of the gladevcp.util support for persistence,
and shows how to get a callback when hal pins, or hal input widgets change.

The hal_togglebutton1 is linked to hal_led1 through complex.hal


run as:
$ gladevcp -u complex.py -H complex.hal complex.ui

or to get a lot of debug output what gladevcp and complex.py are doing:

$ gladevcp -d -d -u complex.py -U debug=3 -H complex.hal complex.ui
