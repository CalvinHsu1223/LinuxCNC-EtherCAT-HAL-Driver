This configuration is for a hobby sized (Sherline) servo-operated
lathe based on the Pluto servo driver.  The hardware is a Pluto FPGA
board ($60) which counts the encoders and generates up/down PWM at
high frequency in order to drive H bridges for the lathe's servos.
On this prototype machine both servos are driven with one L298 dual
H bridge (which is usually used to drive one stepper.)  This is an
example of (very) inexpensive servo use on a hobby machine and it
gives very good performance.
