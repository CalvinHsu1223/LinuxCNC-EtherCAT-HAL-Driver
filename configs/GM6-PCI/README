This configuration uses the General Mechatronics GM6-PCI board, which can control machines up to 6 axis. It has a wide I/O expansion opportunity: isolated home- and end-switches for each axis, 4x8 digital I/O, isolated digital and analogue I/O modules for RS485 field bus.
Please read the GM6-PCI Driver section of the Integrator Manual or visit www.generalmechatronics.com for more information.

Description of sample configurations:

3-axis-servo:
This configuration shows how to set up encoder and axis DAC, and how to connect them to PID hal module. All 3 axes use one home switch and two limit switches. Power fault input is connected to E-stop hal pin.

3-axis-stepper:
This configuration shows how to set up stepgen module. All 3 axes use one home switch and two limit switches. Power fault input is connected to E-stop hal pin.
