Etch-servo drives two servo motors using a simple parallel-port-attached
circuit.  'freqgen' produces an enable waveform to turn the servo motors at a
variable speed, and 'encoder' reads TTL-level quadrature inputs to close the
loop.

The circuit uses an L298 dual full-bridge driver to control two servo motors.
