This example of a racktoolchanger attempts a transliteration of
micges racktoolchanger patch. 

This assumes tool number == pocket number; the pocket number in the tool.tbl is currently ignored.

See http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emcinfo.pl?RackToolChanger .

NB: 

I dont fully understand the meanings of the pins involved, and the dwell and moves.
This has NOT been tested on a real machine. Use as starting point for your own
experimentation.
