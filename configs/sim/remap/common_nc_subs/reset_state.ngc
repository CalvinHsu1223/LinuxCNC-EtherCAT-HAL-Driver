; if say a G38 probe was interrupted during a remap, this leaves the G38 modal state active
; clear it out here, and any other state you what to have established after an error
;
; executing an M2 here is NOT recommended here, so we replicate the steps taken by an M2
; but keep executing 

G54 (origin offsets are set to the default)
G17 (select XY plane)
G90 (absolute)
G94 (feed mode: units/minute)
M48 (set feed and speed overrides)
G40 (cutter compensation off)
M5  (spindle off)

; M2 sets G1, but  this fails with feed zero
; a G80 is the next best safe thing
G80 (cancel modal motion)

M9  (mist and coolant off)
