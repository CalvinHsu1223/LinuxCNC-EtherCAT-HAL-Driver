; demo for stopping interpreter readahead
;
; assuming the G70 line is commented out, what would happen is:
;
; the interpreter parses and queues the msg commands, then encounters abort
; and immediately flushes the interpreter queue
; consequence: the message from (msg,xx) dont appear since they are flushed before they can be executed by
; task and the gui.
;
; if G70 is active, this means interpreter readahead stops at that very line until all preceding
; commands have been executed 
; hence the messages appear in that case

(msg,one)
(msg,two)
(msg,three)

G70 (dont lookahead further)

(abort, aborting)
