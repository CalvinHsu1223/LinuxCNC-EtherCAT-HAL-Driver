  like they should, but the icon didn't change from on/off, solved that changin _update_coolant
- when the tool was changed using M61Q, the screen has not been set back to manual mode properly,

- running a macro changed the image and function of the keyboard button, 
  but the tool tip text didn't change, I fixed this.
- it was possible to reduce the max_vel of the machine less than the jog_velocity,

	* gscreen.spindle_overide_counts
	* gscreen.feed_overide_counts

  Does anyone know, why the connection in postgui hal change the jog counts by one and 
  modify this way the scale from 100 to 101?

ver. 0.8.5

  from _update_coolant()
- renamed tbtn_coolant to tbtn_flood
- bugfix on macro goto position caused from self.on_btn_macro_pressed()
- finshed the hal connections also for the vertical buttons
  to test with simulated buttons, you have to uncomment the coresponing lines in INI and postgui.hal
  then two buttonlist will aperear
- There was a problem excecuting the macros with the hardware button, 
  user where able to start a second macro while the first was still running, solved that
- Running macros can be aborted, the show_keyboard button will change it's image and 
  get an other function
 
ver. 0.7.07

- macros can be run by hardware button

  to test the features, just uncomment 3 lines in INI File DISPLAY section, see comments there
  and uncomment the connections made in gmoccapy_postgui.hal
  I need someone to test this with real hardware, as with gladevcp buttons there seems to be
  a problem with the mode settings, change a tool with M61 will not bring you back in manual mode 
  using the software keys, due to gladevcp in my opinion.
