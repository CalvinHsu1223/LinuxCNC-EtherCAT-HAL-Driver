This configuration step is intended for servo machines running the ServoToGo
card. 
Both the STG1 and STG2 are supported, check www.servotogo.com for
additional details.

You can have either a standard pinout (LinuxCNC style) or  you could make a new one 
which would suit your own custom cabling.
Right now the ini file is for metric setup, but an inch specific one could be
easily added.

Detailed description:

* nml files

-- it uses a default nml file (found in configs/common/linuxcnc.nml)

* hal files

-- it uses a default servo hal file (configs/common/core_servo.hal)

-- stg_motion.hal - this is the main hal file for the STG, it loads the stg
driver and sets up motion specific links, it is fairly well commented, so it
should be easy to read / modify.

-- stg_io.hal - this is the second hal file for the STG, it configures IO
specific links (like the pin number where the X limit switch is, or where the
spindle start pin is connected), it is fairly well commented, so it
should be easy to read / modify.
This servo setup is mostly for serious machines, so the ESTOP should really be
planned / implemented properly (that means use an external ESTOP chain, and let
LinuxCNC know about it, and let LinuxCNC interrupt the external chain too).
Read more about this in the wiki at http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/

* additional files

-- stg.tbl - this is the tool table file, and it holds definitions for the
tools used, along with tool sizes for compensation (tool length & tool diameter)

-- stg.var - the variables file. This file is used by the interpreter to save
internal variables when LinuxCNC shuts down, and rereads them on the next startup.
