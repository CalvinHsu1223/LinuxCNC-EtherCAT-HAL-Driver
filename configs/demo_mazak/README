Demo_mazak is a complex set of HAL drivers.  These include
the Motenc-Lite motion card, a PMDX parport card, and a
general purpose ISA slot IO card.  This setup is used
for the Mazak V5 at Cardinal Engineering and is included
here as an example of a way to spread HAL abilities across
a number of devices.

This demo includes an example of using a parallel port to
read a handwheel encoder.  It brings in ClassicLadder to
handle most of the machine logic for gear and tool change.

Don't expect to be able to run this as is unless you have
a matching set of hardware.  Without the exact set of
devices you can still study the hal files to see how
many of these things are accomplished.
