This configuration is for my (petev) Bridgeport BOSS6. It shows how I used
the boss_plc component. It is intended for servo machines running the
Vitalsystems (www.vsi99.com) Motenc-100 or Motenc-Lite card.

You can either have a standard pinout, or you could make a new
one which would suit your own custom cabling. The changes are
done in HAL (the Hardware Abstraction Layer), which is very
flexible (read more about it at http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/)

The standard configuration assumes a card installed with
the board id jumper set at 0. If you get errors, try to
adjust the jumper.

Multiple cards are supported by reading the board id jumper
settings and using them as the <boardId> in the exported
HAL names. There are two jumpers on J3 of the motenc-100
board that are defined as the board id. Installing a jumper
causes the corresponding bit to read as zero. Since there are
two board id jumpers, up to four cards are supported. Using
the board id allows the configuration to be independent of
which PCI slot the card is plugged into.

Detailed description:

* nml files

-- it uses a default nml file (found in configs/common/linuxcnc.nml)

* hal files

-- boss.hal - this is the main hal file for the Motenc, it loads the 
motenc driver and sets up motion and IO links (like the pin number where the
X limit switch is, or where the spindle start pin is connected), it is fairly
well commented, so it should be easy to read / modify.
This servo setup is mostly for serious machines, so the ESTOP should really be
planned / implemented properly (that means use an external ESTOP chain, and let
LinuxCNC know about it, and let LinuxCNC interrupt the external chain too).
Read more about this in the wiki at http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/

* additional files

-- boss.tbl - this is the tool table file, and it holds definitions for the
tools used, along with tool sizes for compensation (tool length & tool diameter)

-- boss.var - the variables file. This file is used by the interpreter to save
internal variables when LinuxCNC shuts down, and rereads them on the next startup.
