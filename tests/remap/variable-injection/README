this regression tests wether:

(1)
- variables inserted in a prolog can be references properly in the NGC procedure
- changes to variables in the NGC procedure can be properly retrieved in the epilog

(2)
- variables inserted in a prolog, NGC procedure or epilog are deleted on the end of a remap
- (1) also works for several remaps in a block
