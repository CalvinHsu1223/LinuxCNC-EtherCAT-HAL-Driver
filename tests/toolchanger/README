The tests in this directory attempt to verify the correct behavior of
the tool table and the tool changer.

Two tests are run: one on a random toolchanger and one on a nonrandom
toolchanger.  Both tests perform the same operations, and expect (nearly)
the same results.

A full LinuxCNC instance is started, with linuxcncrsh as the UI.  A bunch
of gcode commands are run via MDI, and the internal state of LinuxCNC
is accessed via numbered parameters.  A custom M-code shell script is
used to write these parameter values to a file, which is then compared
to a hand-crafted "expected values" file.
