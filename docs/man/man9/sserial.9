.SH NAME

hostmot2 - Smart Serial LinuxCNC HAL driver for the Mesa Electronics HostMot2 
Smart-Serial remote cards
.SH SYNOPSIS
The Mesa Smart-Serial interface is a 2.5Mbs proprietary interface between the
Mesa Anything-IO cards and a range of subsidiary devices termed "smart-serial 
remotes".
The remote cards perform a variety of functions, but typically they combine 
various classes of IO. 
The remot cards are self-configuring, in that they tell the main LinuxCNC 
Hostmot2 driver what their pin functions are and what they should be named. 

Many sserial remotes offer different pinouts depending on the mode they are 
started up in. This is set using the sserial_port_N= option in the 
hm2_pci modparam. See the hostmot2 manpage for further details. 

It is likely that this documentation will be permanently out of date. 

Each Anything-IO board can attach up to 8 sserial remotes to each header 
(either the 5-pin headers on the 5i20/5i22/5i23/7i43 or the 25-pin connectors on
the 5i25, 6i25 and 7i80). The remotes are grouped into "ports" of up to 8
"channels". Typically each header will be a single 8 channel port, but this is
not necessarily always the case. 

.SH PORTS
In addition to the per-channel/device pins detailed below there are three
per-port pins and three parameters.

Pins:

(bit, in) .sserial.port-N.run: Enables the specific Smart Serial module.
Setting this pin low will disable all boards on the port and puts the port in a
pass-through mode where device parameter setting is possible.
This pin defaults to TRUE and can be left unconnected. However, toggling the pin
low-to-high will re-enable a faulted drive so the pin could usefully be
connected to the iocontrol.0.user-enable-out pin.

(u32, ro) .run_state: Shows the state of the sserial communications state-machine.
This pin will generally show a value of 0x03 in normal operation, 0x07 in
setup mode and 0x00 when the "run" pin is false.

(u32, ro) .error-count: Indicates the state of the Smart Serial error handler, 
see the parameters sections for more details. 

Parameters:

(u32 r/w) .fault-inc: Any over-run or handshaking error in the SmartSerial
communications will increment the .fault-count pin by the amount specified by
this parameter. Default = 10.

(u32 r/w) .fault-dec: Every successful read/write cycle decrements the fault
counter by this amount. Default = 1.

(u32 r/w) .fault-lim: When the fault counter reaches this threshold the Smart
Serial interface on the corresponding port will be stopped and an error printed 
in dmesg. Together these three pins allow for control over the degree of fault-
tolerance allowed in the interface. The default values mean that if more than
one transaction in ten fails, more than 20 times, then a hard error will be
raised. If the increment were to be set to zero then no error would ever be
raised, and the system would carry on regardless. Conversely setting decrement to 
zero, threshold to 1 and limit to 1 means that absolutely no errors will be
tolerated. (This structure is copied directly from vehicle ECU practice)

.SH DEVICES
The other pins and parameters created in HAL depend on the devices detected.
The following list of Smart Serial devices is by no means exhaustive. 

.TP
.SH 8i20
The 8i20 is a 2.2kW three-phase drive for brushless DC motors and AC servo
motors.
8i20 pins and parameters have names like
"hm2_\fI<BoardType>\fR.\fI<BoardNum>\fR.8i20.\fI<PortNum>\fR.\fI<ChanNum>\fR.\fI<Pin>\fR", for example
"hm2_5i23.0.8i20.1.3.current" would set the phase current for the drive
connected to the fourth channel of the second sserial port of the first 5i23
board. Note that the sserial ports do not necessarily correlate in layout or
number to the physical ports on the card.

Pins:

.TP
(float in) angle
The rotor angle of the motor in fractions of a full
\fBphase\fR revolution. An angle of 0.5 indicates that the motor is half a turn
/ 180 degrees / \[*p] radians from the zero position. The zero position is taken to
be the position that the motor adopts under no load with a poitive voltage
applied to the A (or U) phase and both B and C (or V and W) connected to -V or
0V. A 6 pole motor will have 3 zero positions per physical rotation. Note that
the 8i20 drive automatically adds the phase lead/lag angle, and that this pin
should see the raw rotor angle. There is a HAL module (bldc) which handles the
complexity of differing motor and drive types.

.TP
(float, in) current
The phase current command to the drive. This is scaled
from -1 to +1 for forwards and reverse maximum currents. The absolute value of
the current is set by the max_current parameter.

.TP
(float, ro) voltage
The drive bus voltage in V. This will tend to show 25.6V
when the drive is unpowered and the drive will not operate below about 50V.

.TP
(float, ro) temp
The temperature of the driver in degrees C.

.TP
(u32, ro) comms
The communication status of the drive. See the manual for
more details.

.TP 
(bit, ro) status and fault.

Pins:
(bit, in) 7i64.0.0.output-NN: Writing a 1 or TRUE to this pin will enable output

isolated and both pins of each input must be connected (typically to signal and
the ground of the signal. This need not be the ground of the board.)

(float, out) 7i64.0.0.analog0 & 7i64.0.0.analog1: The two analogue inputs 
(0 to 3.3V) on the board.

Parameters:
(bit, rw) 7i64.0.0.output-NN-invert: Setting this parameter to 1 / TRUE will invert
the output value, such that writing 0 to .gpio.NN.out will enable the output
and vice-versa.

.TP
.SH 7i76
The 7i76 is not only a smart-serial device. It also serves as a breakout for a
number of other Hostmot2 functions. There are connections for 5 step generators
(for which see the main hostmot2 manpage). The stepgen pins are associated with 
the 5i25 (hm2_5i25.0.stepgen.00....) whereas the smart-serial pins are

direction terminals on the 7i76 board.

7i76 board.

the signal can be set via a parameter

(u32 ro) .7i76.0.0.nvbaudrate: Indicates the vbaud rate. This probably should 
not be altered, and special utils are needed to do so.

should match a siticker on the card. This can be useful for wokring out which 
card is which.

is separate from the Anything-IO card timeout. This is unlikley to need to be

output pin.

spinout-maxlim were set to 5,000 rpm then no voltage above 5V would be output.

Utilities exist to update and change this firmware.

value of 10,000 rpm on the spinout pin would produce 10V output. However, if
spinout-maxlim were set to 5,000 rpm then no voltage above 5V would be output.

.SH 7i70

The 7I70 is a remote isolated 48 input card. The 7I70 inputs sense positive

voltage can range from 5VDC to 32VDC. All inputs have LED status indicators.

higher maximum update rates.
