.SH NAME
motion \- accepts NML motion commands, interacts with HAL in realtime
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBloadrt motmod [base_period_nsec=\fIperiod\fB] [base_thread_fp=\fI0 or 1\fB] [servo_period_nsec=\fIperiod\fB] [traj_period_nsec=\fIperiod\fB] [num_joints=\fI[0-9]\fB] ([num_dio=\fI[1-64]\fB] [num_aio=\fI[1-16]\fB])

.SH DESCRIPTION
By default, the base thread does not support floating point.  Software stepping, software encoder counting, and software pwm do not use floating point.  \fBbase_thread_fp\fR can be used to enable floating point in the base thread (for example for brushless DC motor control).

.P
These pins and parameters are created by the realtime \fBmotmod\fR module. This module provides a HAL interface for LinuxCNC's motion planner. Basically \fBmotmod\fR takes in a list of waypoints and generates a nice blended and constraint-limited stream of joint positions to be fed to the motor drives. 

.P
Optionally the number of Digital I/O is set with num_dio. The number of Analog I/O is set with num_aio. The default is 4 each.

.P
Pin names starting with "\fBaxis\fR" are actually joint values, but the pins and parameters are still called "\fBaxis.\fIN\fR". They are read and updated by the motion-controller function.

.SH PINS

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.amp-enable-out\fR OUT BIT 
TRUE if the amplifier for this joint should be enabled

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.amp-fault-in\fR IN BIT 
Should be driven TRUE if an external fault is detected with the amplifier for this joint

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.home-sw-in\fR IN BIT 
Should be driven TRUE if the home switch for this joint is closed

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.homing\fR OUT BIT 
TRUE if the joint is currently homing

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.index-enable\fR IO BIT 
Should be attached to the index-enable pin of the joint's encoder to enable homing to index pulse

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.is-unlocked\fR IN BIT
If the axis is a locked rotary the unlocked sensor should be connected to this pin

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.jog-counts\fR IN S32 
Connect to the "counts" pin of an external encoder to use a physical jog wheel.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.jog-enable\fR IN BIT 
When TRUE (and in manual mode), any change to "jog-counts" will result in motion. When false, "jog-counts" is ignored.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.jog-scale\fR IN FLOAT 
Sets the distance moved for each count on "jog-counts", in machine units.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.jog-vel-mode\fR IN BIT 
When FALSE (the default), the jogwheel operates in position mode. The axis will move exactly jog-scale units for each count, regardless of how long that might take. When TRUE, the wheel operates in velocity mode - motion stops when the wheel stops, even if that means the commanded motion is not completed.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.joint-pos-cmd\fR OUT FLOAT 
The joint (as opposed to motor) commanded position. There may be several offsets between the joint and motor coordinates: backlash compensation, screw error compensation, and home offsets.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.joint-pos-fb\fR OUT FLOAT 
The joint feedback position. This value is computed from the actual motor position minus joint offsets. Useful for machine visualization.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.motor-pos-cmd\fR OUT FLOAT 
The commanded position for this joint.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.motor-pos-fb\fR IN FLOAT

TRUE if the axis is a locked rotary and a move is commanded.

.TP
\fBmotion.debug-\fI*\fR 
These values are used for debugging purposes. 
.TP
\fBmotion.servo.last-period\fR

By noting large differences between successive values of motion.servo.last-period, the motion controller can determine that there has probably been a failure to meet its timing constraints. Each time such a failure is detected, this value is incremented.

Generally, these functions are both added to the servo-thread in the order shown.

.TP
\fBmotion-command-handler\fR 
Processes motion commands coming from user space
