.SH NAME

hm2_bspi_setup_chan \- setup a Hostmot2 bspi channel

.SH SYNTAX
.HP
int hm2_bspi_setup_chan(char *name, int chan, int cs, int bits, float mhz,
int delay, int cpol, int cpha, int clear, int echo)

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhm2_bspi_setup_chan\fR Setup the bspi channel "chan" on the bspi instance 
"name". "name" is a unique string given to each bspi channel during hostmot2 
setup. The names of the available
channels are printed to standard output during the driver loading process and 
take the form:
hm2_<board name>.<board index>.bspi.<index> For example hm2_5i23.0.bspi.0
Channels are numbered 0 to 15.
The value on the chip-select lines is set by cs and need not match the
channel number. BSPI supports 4 chip select lines, so the valid range for cs is 
0-15. "bits" sets the bit-length of the SPI packet. The maximum supported length
is 64 bits but this will span two read FIFO entries and will need special 
handling. "mhz" sets the chip communication rate. The maximum value for this is 
half the FPGA base frequency, so for example with a 48MHz 5i23 the max SPI 
frequency is 24Mhz. Values in excess of the max supported will be silently 
rounded down. "delay" sets the chip select valid delay (in nS). "cpha" is the 
clock phase and "cpol" is the clock polarity (from the device datasheet). 
"clear" controls whether the frame clear bit is set after the 32 bit buffer 
transfer. This parameter should be set to 1 when the frame length is greater 
than 32 bits and the next data in the FIFO contains the other bits. "echo" is 
sense-inverted, it should be set to 1 for devices which do not return data (such
 as DACs). 

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
