.SH NAME

hm2_tram_add_bspi_frame \- add a register-write to the Hostmot2 TRAM

.SH SYNTAX
.HP
hm2_tram_add_bspi_frame(char *name, int chan, u32 **wbuff, u32 **rbuff)

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhm2_tram_add_bspi_frame\fR Add a regular (every thread) write event to the 
Hostmot2 tram for bspi instance "name". "name" is a unique string given to each 
bspi channel during hostmot2 setup. The names of the available
channels are printed to standard output during the driver loading process and 
take the form:
hm2_<board name>.<board index>.bspi.<index> For example hm2_5i23.0.bspi.0

This function is used to add a regular, every thread, write or write-read 
transaction to the Translation RAM system. A write need not have a read (use 0
for **rbuff) but it is an error to have a read without a write. Note that the 
TRAM list is not actioned until the hm2_allocate_bspi_tram function is called. 
The read and write parameters must be pointers to pointers, as TRAM re-maps the 
buffers into contiguous memory. 

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
