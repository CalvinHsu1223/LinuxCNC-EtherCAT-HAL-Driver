.SH SYNTAX
.HP
 int rtapi_mutex_try(unsigned long *\fImutex\fR)

.HP
 void rtapi_mutex_get(unsigned long *\fImutex\fR)

.HP
 void rtapi_mutex_give(unsigned long *\fImutex\fR)

.SH  ARGUMENTS
.IP \fImutex\fR
A pointer to the mutex.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrtapi_mutex_try\fR makes a non-blocking attempt to get the mutex.
If the mutex is available, it returns 0, and the mutex is no longer available.
Otherwise, it returns a nonzero value.

\fBrtapi_mutex_get\fR blocks until the mutex is available.

\fBrtapi_mutex_give\fR releases a mutex acquired by \fBrtapi_mutex_try\fR or
\fBrtapi_mutex_get\fR.

.SH REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS
\fBrtapi_mutex_give\fR and \fBrtapi_mutex_try\fR may be used from user,
init/cleanup, and realtime code.

\fBrtapi_mutex_get\fR may not be used from realtime code.

.SH RETURN VALUE
\fBrtapi_mutex_try\fR returns 0 for if the mutex was claimed, and nonzero
otherwise.

\fBrtapi_mutex_get\fR and \fBrtapi_mutex_gif\fR have no return value.
