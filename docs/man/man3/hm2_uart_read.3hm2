.SH NAME

hm2_uart_read \- read data from a Hostmot2 UART buffer

.SH SYNTAX
.HP
int hm2_uart_read(char *name, unsigned char *data)

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhm2_uart_read\fR read data from the UART "name".
"name" is a unique string given to each UART during hostmot2 setup. The names of 
the available channels are printed to standard output during the driver loading 
process and take the form:
hm2_<board name>.<board index>.uart.<index> For example hm2_5i23.0.uart.0

This function reads a variable number of bytes from the the specified 
channel.It should be used inside a realtime HAL component registered with the 
main hostmot2 driver using the function hm2_uart_set_read_function in the setup
code. 

Note that the UART Receieve FIFO is only 16 bytes deep,(the transmit FIFO is 64 
bytes) and "data" needs to be at least that large or undefined mayhem will ensue. 

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of bytes read on success and -1 on failure.
