.SH NAME

hm2_bspi_write_chan \- write data to a Hostmot2 Buffered SPI channel

.SH SYNTAX
.HP
hm2_bspi_write_chan(char* name, int chan, u32 val)

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhm2_bspi_write_chan\fR write one-time data to the bspi channel "chan" on the 
bspi instance "name". "name" is a unique string given to each bspi channel 
during hostmot2 setup. The names of the available
channels are printed to standard output during the driver loading process and 
take the form:
hm2_<board name>.<board index>.bspi.<index> For example hm2_5i23.0.bspi.0

This function performs a one-time write of data to the specified channel. It is
typically used for setup and chip enabling purposes. It should not be used in 
the main loop for regular data transfers (but is appropriate to use for on-the-
fly setup changes).

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
