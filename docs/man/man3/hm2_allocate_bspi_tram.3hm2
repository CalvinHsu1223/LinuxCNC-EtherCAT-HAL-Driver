.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhm2_allocate_bspi_tram\fR Allocate the TRAM memory for bspi instance "name". 
"name" is a unique string given to each bspi channel during hostmot2 setup. 
The names of the available channels are printed to standard output during the 
driver loading process and take the form:
hm2_<board name>.<board index>.bspi.<index> For example hm2_5i23.0.bspi.0

This function allocates the TRAM memory and sets up the regular data transfers. 
It should be called only when all the frames have been defined by calls to 
hm2_tram_add_bspi_frame(). 

.SH RETURN VALUE
