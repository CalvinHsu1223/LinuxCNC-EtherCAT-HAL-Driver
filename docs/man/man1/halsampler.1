.TH HALSAMPLER "1"  "2006-11-18" "LinuxCNC Documentation" "HAL User's Manual"
.SH NAME
halsampler \- sample data from HAL in realtime
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B halsampler
.RI [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR sampler (9)
and
.B halsampler
are used together to sample HAL data in real time and store it in a file.
.B sampler
is a realtime HAL component that exports HAL pins and creates a FIFO in shared memory.  It then begins sampling data from the HAL and storing it to the FIFO.
.B halsampler
is a user space program that copies data from the FIFO to stdout, where it can
be redirected to a file or piped to some other program.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-c " CHAN
instructs 
.B halsampler
to read from FIFO
.IR CHAN .
FIFOs are numbered from zero, and the default value is zero, so
this option is not needed unless multiple FIFOs have been created.
.TP
.BI "-n " COUNT
instructs 
.B halsampler
to read
.I COUNT
samples from the FIFO, then exit.  If
.B -n
is not specified,
.B halsampler
will read continuously until it is killed.
.TP
.B -t
instructs 
.B halsampler
to tag each line by printing the sample number in the first column.
.TP
.B FILENAME
instructs
.B halsampler
to write to \fBFILENAME\fR instead of to stdout.
.SH USAGE
A FIFO must first be created by loading 
.BR sampler (9)
with 
.B halcmd loadrt
or a
.B loadrt
command in a .hal file.  Then
.B halsampler
can be invoked to begin printing data from the FIFO to stdout.
.P
Data is printed one line per sample.  If
.B -t
was specified, the sample number is printed first.  The data follows, in the
order that the pins were defined in the config string.  For example, if the
.B sampler
config string was "ffbs" then a typical line of output (without
.BR -t )
would look like:
.P
123.55 33.4 0 -12
.P
.B halsampler
prints data as fast as possible until the FIFO is empty, then it retries at regular intervals, until it is either killed or has printed
.I COUNT
samples as requested by
.BR -n .
Usually, but not always, data printed by
.B halsampler
will be redirected to a file or piped to some other program.
.P
The FIFO size should be chosen to absorb samples captured during any momentary disruptions in the flow of data, such as disk seeks, terminal scrolling, or the processing limitations of subsequent program in a pipeline.  If the FIFO gets
full and
.B sampler
is forced to overwrite old data,
.B halsampler
will print 'overrun' on a line by itself to mark each gap in the sampled
data.  If
.B -t
was specified, gaps in the sequential sample numbers in the first column
can be used to determine exactly how many samples were lost.
.P
The data format for
.B halsampler
output is the same as for
.BR halstreamer (1)
input, so 'waveforms' captured with
.B halsampler
can be replayed using
.BR halstreamer .
The
.B -t
option should not be used in this case.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
If a problem is encountered during initialization,
.B halsampler
prints a message to stderr and returns failure.
.P
Upon printing
.I COUNT
samples (if
.B -n
was specified) it will shut down and return success.  If it is terminated
before printing the specified number of samples, it returns failure.  This
means that when
.B -n
is not specified, it will always return failure when terminated.
