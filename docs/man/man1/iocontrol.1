.SH NAME
iocontrol \- accepts NML I/O commands, interacts with HAL in userspace

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBloadusr io [-ini \fIinifile\fB]


.SH DESCRIPTION
These pins are created by the userspace IO controller, usually found in $LINUXCNC_HOME/bin/io
.P
The signals are turned on and off in userspace - if you have strict timing requirements or simply need more i/o, consider using the realtime synchronized i/o provided by \fBmotion\fR(9) instead.
.P
The inifile is searched for in the directory from which halcmd was run, unless an absolute path is specified.
