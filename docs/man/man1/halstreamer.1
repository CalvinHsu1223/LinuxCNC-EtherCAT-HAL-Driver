.TH HALSTREAMER "1"  "2006-11-18" "LinuxCNC Documentation" "HAL User's Manual"
.SH NAME
halstreamer \- stream file data into HAL in real time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B halstreamer
.RI [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR streamer (9)
and
.B halstreamer
are used together to stream data from a file into the HAL in real time.
.B streamer
is a realtime HAL component that exports HAL pins and creates a FIFO in shared memory.
.B hal_streamer
is a user space program that copies data from stdin into the FIFO, so that
.B streamer
can write it to the HAL pins.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-c " CHAN
instructs 
.B halstreamer
to write to FIFO
.IR CHAN .
FIFOs are numbered from zero, and the default value is zero, so
this option is not needed unless multiple FIFOs have been created.
.TP
.B FILENAME
instructs
.B halsampler
to read from \fBFILENAME\fR instead of from stdin.
.SH USAGE
A FIFO must first be created by loading 
.BR streamer (9)
with 
.B halcmd loadrt
or a
.B loadrt
command in a .hal file.  Then
.B halstreamer
can be invoked to begin writing data into the FIFO.
.P
Data is read from stdin, and is almost always either redirected from a file
or piped from some other program, since keyboard input would be unable to keep
up with even slow streaming rates.
.P
Each line of input must match the pins that are attached to the FIFO, for example, if the
.B streamer
config string was "ffbs" then each
line of input must consist of two floats, a bit, and a signed integer, in that
order and separated by whitespace.  Floats must be formatted as required by
.BR strtod (3),
signed and unsigned integers must be formated as required by
.BR strtol (3)
and
.BR strtoul (3),
and bits must be either '0' or '1'.
.P
.B halstreamer
transfers data to the FIFO as fast as possible until the FIFO is full, then it retries at regular intervals, until it is either killed or reads 
.B EOF
from stdin.  Data can be redirected from a file or piped from some other program.
.P
The FIFO size should be chosen to ride through any momentary disruptions in the flow of data, such as disk seeks.  If the FIFO is big enough,
.B halstreamer
can be restarted with the same or a new file before the FIFO empties, resulting in a continuous stream of data.
.P
The data format for
.B halstreamer
input is the same as for
.BR halsampler (1)
output, so 'waveforms' captured with
.B halsampler
can be replayed using
.B halstreamer.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
If a problem is encountered during initialization,
.B halstreamer
prints a message to stderr and returns failure.
.P
If a badly formatted line is encountered while writing to the FIFO, it prints a message to stderr, skips the line, and continues (this behavior may be revised in the future).
.P
Upon reading
.B EOF
from the input, it returns success.  If it is terminated before the input ends, it returns failure.
