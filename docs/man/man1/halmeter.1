.TH HALMETER "1"  "2006-03-13" "LinuxCNC Documentation" "HAL User's Manual"
.SH NAME
halmeter \- observe HAL pins, signals, and parameters
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B halmeter
[\fB-s\fR] [\fBpin\fR|\fBsig\fR|\fBparam\fR \fIname\fR] [\fB-g\fR \fIX-positon Y-position [Width]\fR] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhalmeter\fR is used to observe HAL (Hardware Abstraction
Layer) pins, signals, or parameters.  It serves the same
purpose as a multimeter does when working on physical systems.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fBpin\fR \fIname\fR
display the HAL pin \fIname\fR.
.TP
\fBsig\fR \fIname\fR
display the HAL signal \fIname\fR.
.TP
\fBparam\fR \fIname\fR
display the HAL parameter \fIname\fR.
.TP
If neither \fBpin\fR, \fBsig\fR, or \fBparam\fR are specified, the
window starts out blank and the user must select an item to observe.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR
small window.  Non-interactive, must be used with \fBpin\fR, \fBsig\fR,
or \fBparam\fR to select the item to display.  The item name is displayed 
in the title bar instead of the window, and there are no "Select" or "Exit"
buttons.  Handy when you want a lot of meters in a small space.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR
geometry position.  allows one to specify the intial starting position
and optionally the width of the meter. Referenced from top left of screen 
in pixel units.
Handy when you want to load a lot of meters in a script with out them
displaying on top of each other.
.SH USAGE
Unless \fB\-s\fR is specified, there are two buttons, "Select" and "Exit".
"Select" opens a dialog box to select the item (pin, signal, or parameter)
to be observed.  "Exit" does what you expect.

The selection dialog has "OK" "Apply", and "Cancel" buttons.  OK displays
the selected item and closes the dialog.  "Apply" displays the selected
item but keeps the selection dialog open.  "Cancel" closes the dialog
without changing the displayed item.

.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
\fBhalmeter\fR
Opens a meter window, with nothing initially displayed.  Use the "Select"
button to choose an item to observe.  Does not return until the window
is closed.
.TP
\fBhalmeter &\fR
Open a meter window, with nothing initially displayed.  Use the "Select"
button to choose an item.  Runs in the background leaving the shell 
free for other commands.
.TP
\fBhalmeter pin\fR \fIparport.0.pin-03-out\fR \fB&\fR
Open a meter window, initially displaying HAL pin \fIparport.0.pin-03-out\fR.
The "Select" button can be used to display other items.  Runs in background.

.TP
\fBhalmeter -s pin\fR \fIparport.0.pin-03-out\fR \fB&\fR
Open a small meter window, displaying HAL pin \fIparport.0.pin-03-out\fR.
The displayed item cannot be changed.  Runs in background.

.TP
\fBhalmeter -s pin\fR \fIparport.0.pin-03-out\fR \fB-g\fR \fI100 500\fR \fB&\fR 
Open a small meter window, displaying HAL pin \fIparport.0.pin-03-out\fR.
places it 100 pixels to the left and 500 pixels down from top of screen.
The displayed item cannot be changed.  Runs in background.

.TP
\fBhalmeter -s pin\fR \fIparport.0.pin-03-out\fR \fB-g\fR \fI100 500 400\fR \fB&\fR 
Open a small meter window, displaying HAL pin \fIparport.0.pin-03-out\fR.
places it 100 pixels to the left and 500 pixels down from top of screen.
The width will be 400 pixels (270 is default)
The displayed item cannot be changed.  Runs in background.
