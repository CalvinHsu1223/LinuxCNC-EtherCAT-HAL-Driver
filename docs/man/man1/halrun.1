.TH HALRUN "1"  "2012-01-31" "LinuxCNC Documentation" "HAL User's Manual"
.SH NAME
halrun \- manipulate the LinuxCNC HAL from the command line
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B halrun \fI-h\fR
.PP
.B halrun [\fI-I\fR] [\fIhalcmd_opts\fR] [\fIfilename[.hal|.tcl]\fR]
.PP
.B halrun \fI-T\fR [\fIhalcmd_opts\fR] [\fIfilename[.hal|.tcl]\fR]
.PP
.B halrun \fI-U\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhalrun\fR is a convenience script used to manipulate the HAL (Hardware
Abstraction Layer) from the command line.  When invoked, \fBhalrun\fR:

    Sets up the realtime environment.
    Executes a command interpreter (\fBhalcmd\fR or \fBhaltcl\fR).
    (Optionally) runs an interactive session.
    Tears down the realtime environment.

    If no filename is specified, an interactive session is started.
    The session will use \fBhalcmd\fR(1) unless -T is specified in
    which case \fBhaltcl\fR(1) will be used.

    If a filename is specifed and neither the -I nor the -T option
    is included, the filename will be processed by the command
    interpreter corresponding to the filename extension (\fBhalcmd\fR
    or \fBhaltcl\fR).  After processing, the realtime environment
    will be torn down.

    If a filename is specifed and the -I or -T option is included,
    the file is processed by the appropriate command interpreter and
    then an interactive session is started for \fBhalcmd\fR or
    \fBhaltcl\fR according to the -I or -T option.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fBhalcmd_opts\fR
When a .hal file is specifed, the \fBhalcmd_opts\fR are
passed to \fBhalcmd\fR.  See the man page for \fBhalcmd\fR(1).
When a .tcl file is specified, the only valid options are:
    -i inifile
    -f filename[.tcl|.hal]  (alternate means of specifying a file)
.TP
\fB-I\fR
Run an interactive \fBhalcmd\fR session
.TP
\fB-T\fR
Run an interactive \fBhaltcl\fR session.
.TP
\fB-U\fR
Forcibly cause the realtime environment to exit.  It releases the HAL mutex,
requests that all HAL components unload, and stops the realtime system.
\fB-U\fR must be the only commandline argument.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
display a brief help screen and exit
