.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcomp\fR performs many different functions:
.IP \(bu 4
Compile \fB.comp\fR and \fB.c\fR files into \fB.so\fR or \fB.ko\fR HAL realtime components (the \fB--compile\fR flag)
.IP \(bu 4
Compile \fB.comp\fR and \fB.c\fR files into HAL userspace components (the \fB--compile --userspace\fR flag)
.IP \(bu 4
Preprocess \fB.comp\fR files into \fB.c\fR files (the \fB--preprocess\fR flag)
.IP \(bu 4
Extract documentation from \fB.comp\fR files into \fB.9\fR manpage files (the \fB--document\fR flag)
.IP \(bu 4
Display documentation from \fB.comp\fR files onscreen (the \fB--view-doc\fR flag)
.IP \(bu 4
Compile and install \fB.comp\fR and \fB.c\fR files into the proper directory for HAL realtime components (the \fB--install\fR flag), which may require \fIsudo\fR to write to system directories.
.IP \(bu 4
Install \fB.c\fR and \fB.py\fR files into the proper directory for HAL userspace components (the \fB--install --userspace\fR flag), which may require \fIsudo\fR to write to system directories.
.IP \(bu 4
Extract documentation from \fB.comp\fR files into \fB.9\fR manpage files in the proper system directory (the \fB--install\fR flag), which may require \fIsudo\fR to write to system directories.
.IP \(bu 4
Preprocess \fB.comp\fR files into \fB.c\fR files (the \fB--preprocess\fR flag)
