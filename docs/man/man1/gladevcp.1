.SH NAME
gladevcp \- Virtual Control Panel for LinuxCNC based on Glade, Gtk and HAL widgets
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgladevcp\fR [-g \fIWxH+X+Y\fR] [-c \fIcomponent-name\fR] [-u \fIhandler\fR] [-U \fIuseroption\fR] [-H \fIhalfile\fR] [-d] \fImyfile.ui\fR
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-g\fR \fIWxH+X+Y\fR
This sets the initial geometry of the root window.
Use 'WxH' for just size, '+X+Y' for just position, or 'WxH+X+Y' for both.
Size / position use pixel units. Position is referenced from top left. 
.TP
\fB-c\fR \fIcomponent-name\fR
Use \fIcomponent-name\fR as the HAL component name.  If the component name is
not specified, the basename of the ui file is used.\fR
.TP
\fB-u\fR \fIhandler\fR
Instructs gladevcp to inspect the Python script \fIhandler\fR for event handlers,
and connect them to signals in the ui file.\fR
.TP
\fB-U\fR \fIuseroption\fR
gladevcp collects all \fIuseroption\fR strings and passes them to the handler init()
method as a list of strings without further inspection.\fR
.TP
\fB-x\fR \fIXID\fR
Reparent gladevcp into an existing window \fIXID\fR instead of
creating a new top level window.\fR
.TP
\fB-H\fR \fIhalfile\fR
gladevcp runs \fIhalfile\fR - a list of HAL commands - by executing \fIhalcmd -c halfile\fR
after the HAL component is finalized.\fR

.TP
\fB-d\fR
enable debug output.

.TP
\fB-R\fR \fIgtkrcfile\fR
explicitly load a gtkrc file.\fR

.TP
\fB-t\fR \fITHEME\fR
set gtk theme. Default is \fIsystem\fR theme. Different panels can have different themes.

.TP
\fB-m\fR \fIMAXIMUM\fR
force panel window to maxumize.  Together with the \fI-g geometry\fR option 
one can move the panel to a second monitor and force it to use all of the screen

.TP
\fB-R\fR
explicitly deactivate workaround for a gtk bug which makes matches of widget and widget_class
matches in gtk theme and gtkrc files fail. Normally not needed.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

and the associated HAL widget set, along with examples
