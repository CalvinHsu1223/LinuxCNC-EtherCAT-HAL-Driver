8.2 Header

Titles
======
= Document Title (level 0) =  Note: level 0 can only be once per file!
== Section title (level 1) ==  Note: trailing delimiter is optional.
=== Section title (level 2) ===

Links
=====
[[anchor]]
<<anchor,caption>>

Example
[[sub:torpodeos]]

<<sub:torpodeos,bombs>>

only bombs will show in the text with an underline so always provide a caption for a link


Listing Block for G Code and terminal output
============================================
---- < 4 dashes start of block
lines of code
...
more code
---- < 4 dashes end of block
     < 1 blank line after

Literal blocks
==============
.... < 4 periods start the block
literal block
will show up
just as you type it.
.... < 4 periods end the block
     < 1 blank line after

Lists
=====
* bullet
** bullet

. numbered
.. numbered

List Item Continuation
* List item paragaph one
  continued with a single plus hard left.
+
List item one continued 
   with a second paragraph
   and first line of second paragraph must be hard left.

HAL pins and parameters use the following format for consistency
* 'parport.<p>.pin-<n>-out' (bit) Drives a physical output pin.
bulleted list with the pin name emphasized by surrounding it with 
single quotes.

Images
======
put all images in the images subdirectory

image::<target>[<attributes>]

example
image::images/axis.png[]
image::images/tiger.png["Tiger image",align="center"]

If the image is small and displays too big in the pdf you can
use the scaledwidth="60%" attribute

Inline Images
=============
Same as images except only one : is used and no attributes are used between 
the []

My text has an image in it image:images/axisbutton.png[]

Figures
=======
Use the following format for figures so any links to the anchor will move to
correct place. Only create a link to a figure if it is somewhere else and not 
the next thing you see when scrolling down. Just say something like "in the 
following figure..."

[[fig:Parport-block-diag]]

.Parport Block Diagram

image::images/parport-block-diag.png[align="center"]


Escaping a character
====================
Normally characters like ' and * would not print unless you use \' or \* then
they will print as normal characters.

Making a horizontal labeled list.
[horizontal]
Label:: The text about the label

Latexmath is broken at the moment and trashes the HTML. A work around is to use open office math
to create the math image and gimp to screen capture and save to a png.

check asciidoc cheatsheet http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc or user manual
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html for details about format.
