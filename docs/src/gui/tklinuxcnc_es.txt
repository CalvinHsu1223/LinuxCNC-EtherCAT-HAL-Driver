== Introduction

TkLinuxCNC(((tkLinuxCNC))) is one of the first graphical front-ends
for LinuxCNC. It is written in Tcl and uses the Tk toolkit
for the display. Being written in Tcl makes it very portable (it runs on a
multitude of platforms). A separate backplot window can be displayed as
shown.

.TkLinuxCNC Window[[cap:TkLinuxCNC-Window]]

== Getting Started

To select TkLinuxCNC as the front-end for LinuxCNC, edit the .ini file. In the
section '[DISPLAY]' change the 'DISPLAY' line to read

----
DISPLAY = tklinuxcnc
----

Then, start LinuxCNC and select that ini file. The sample configuration
'sim/tklinuxcnc/tklinuxcnc.ini' is already configured to use TkLinuxCNC as its front-end.

=== A typical session with TkLinuxCNC

. Start LinuxCNC and select a configuration file.
. Clear the 'E-STOP' condition and turn the machine on (by
 pressing F1 then F2).
. 'Home' each axis.
. Load the file to be milled.
. Put the stock to be milled on the table.
. Set the proper offsets for each axis by jogging and either homing
 again or right-clicking an axis name and entering an offset value.
 footnote:[For some of these actions it might be necessary to change the
 mode LinuxCNC is currently running in.]
. Run the program.
. To mill the same file again, return to step 6. To mill a different
 file, return to step 4. When you're done, exit LinuxCNC.

== Elements of the TkLinuxCNC window

The TkLinuxCNC window contains the following elements:

* A menubar that allows you to perform various actions
* A set of buttons that allow you to change the current working mode,
  start/stop spindle and other relevant I/O
* Status bar for various offset related displays
* Coordinate display area
* A set of sliders which control 'Jogging speed', 'Feed Override' 
  , and 'Spindle speed Override' which allow you to increase or
  decrease those settings
* Manual data input text box 'MDI'
* Status bar display with active G-codes, M-codes, F- and S-words
* Interpreter related buttons
* A text display area that shows the G-code source of the loaded file

=== Main buttons

From left to right, the buttons are:

* Machine enable: 'ESTOP' > 'ESTOP RESET' > 'ON' 
* Toggle mist coolant
* Decrease spindle speed
*  Set spindle direction 'SPINDLE OFF' > 'SPINDLE FORWARD' .
 'SPINDLE REVERSE'
* Increase spindle speed
* Abort

then on the second line:

* Operation mode: 'MANUAL' > 'MDI' > 'AUTO'
* Toggle flood coolant
* Toggle spindle brake control

=== Offset display status bar

The Offset display status bar displays the currently selected tool
(selected with Txx M6), the tool length offset (if active), and the
work offsets (set by right-clicking the coordinates).

=== Coordinate Display Area

The main part of the display shows the current position of the tool.
The color of the position readout depends on the state of the axis. If
the axis is unhomed the axis will be displayed in yellow letters. Once
homed it will be displayed in green letters. If there is an error with
the current axis TkLinuxCNC will use red letter to show that. (for example
if an hardware limit switch is tripped).

To properly interpret these numbers, refer to the radio boxes on the
right. If the position is 'Machine', then the displayed number is in
the machine coordinate system. If it is 'Relative', then the displayed
number is in the offset coordinate system. Further down the choices can
be 'actual' or 'commanded'. Actual refers to the feedback coming from
encoders (if you have a servo machine), and the 'commanded' refers to
the position command send out to the motors. These values can differ
for several reasons: Following error, deadband, encoder resolution, or
step size. For instance, if you command a movement to X 0.0033 on your
mill, but one step of your stepper motor is 0.00125, then the
'Commanded' position will be 0.0033 but the 'Actual' position will be
0.0025 (2 steps) or 0.00375 (3 steps).

Another set of radio buttons allows you to choose between 'joint' and
'world' view. These make little sense on a normal type of machine (e.g.
trivial kinematics), but help on machines with non-trivial kinematics
like robots or stewart platforms. (you can read more about kinematics
in the Integrator Manual).

==== Backplot

When the machine moves, it leaves a trail called the backplot. You can
start the backplot window by selecting Viewâ†’Backplot.

=== Automatic control

==== Buttons for control

The buttons in the lower part of TkLinuxCNC are used to control the execution of a
program: 'Open' to load a program, 'Verify' to
check it for errors, 'Run' to start the actual cutting,
'Pause' to stop it while running, 'Resume' to
resume an already paused program, 'Step' to advance one line
in the program and 'Optional Stop' to toggle the
optional stop switch (if the button is green the program execution will
be stopped on any M1 encountered).

.TkLinuxCNC Interpreter / program control[[cap:TkLinuxCNC-Interpreter]]

==== Text Program Display Area

When the program is running, the line currently being executed is
highlighted in white. The text display will automatically scroll to
show the current line.

=== Manual Control

==== Implicit keys

TkLinuxCNC allows you to manually move the machine. This action is known as
'jogging'. First, select the axis to be moved by clicking it. Then,
click and hold the '+' or '-' button depending on the desired direction
of motion. The first four axes can also be moved by the keyboard arrow keys 
(X and Y), the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys (Z) and the '[' and ']' keys (A/4th). 

If 'Continuous' is selected, the motion will continue as long as the
button or key is pressed. If another value is selected, the machine
will move exactly the displayed distance each time the button is
clicked or the key is pressed. The available values are:
'1.0000, 0.1000, 0.0100, 0.0010, 0.0001'

By pressing 'Home' or the HOME key, the selected axis will be homed.
Depending on your configuration, this may just set the axis value to be
the absolute position 0.0, or it may make the machine move to a
specific home location through use of 'home switches'. See the
Integrator Manual for more information on homing.

By pressing 'Override Limits', the machine will temporarily be
permitted to jog outside the limits defined in the .ini file. (Note: if
'Override Limits' is active the button will be displayed using a red
color).

==== The Spindle group

The button on the first row selects the direction for the spindle to
rotate: Counterclockwise, Stopped, Clockwise. The buttons next to it
allow the user to increase or decrease the rotation speed. The button
on the second row allows the spindle brake to be engaged or released.
Depending on your machine configuration, not all the items in this
group may have an effect.

==== The Coolant group

The two buttons allow the 'Mist' and 'Flood' coolants to be turned on
and off. Depending on your machine configuration, not all the items in
this group may appear.

=== Code Entry

Manual Data Input (also called MDI), allows G-code programs to be
entered manually, one line at a time. When the machine is not turned
on, and not set to MDI mode, the code entry controls are unavailable.

.The Code Entry tab[[cap:The-Code-Entry]]

image::images/tkemc-mdi.png[align="center"]

==== MDI:

This allows you to enter a g-code command to be executed. Execute the
command by pressing Enter.

==== Active G-Codes

This shows the 'modal codes' that are active in the interpreter. For
instance, 'G54' indicates that the 'G54 offset' is applied to all
coordinates that are entered.

=== Jog Speed 

By moving this slider, the speed of jogs can be modified. The numbers
above refer to axis units / second. The text box with the number is
clickable. Once clicked a popup window will appear, allowing for a
number to be entered.

=== Feed Override

By moving this slider, the programmed feed rate can be modified. For
instance, if a program requests 'F60'  and the slider is set to 120%,
then the resulting feed rate will be
72. The text box with the number is clickable. Once clicked a popup
window will appear, allowing for a number to be entered.

=== Spindle speed Override

The spindle speed override slider works exactly like the feed override
slider, but it controls to the spindle speed. If a program requested
S500 (spindle speed 500 RPM), and the slider is set to 80%, then the
resulting spindle speed will be 400 RPM. This slider has a minimum and
maximum value defined in the ini file. If those are missing the slider
is stuck at 100%. The text box with the number is clickable. Once
clicked a popup window will appear, allowing for a number to be
entered.

== Keyboard Controls

Almost all actions in TkLinuxCNC can be accomplished with the keyboard.
Many of the shortcuts are unavailable when in MDI mode.

The most frequently used keyboard shortcuts are shown in the
following table.
