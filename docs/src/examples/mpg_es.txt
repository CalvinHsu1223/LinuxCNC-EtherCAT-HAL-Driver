This example is to explain how to hook up the common MPG pendants
found on the market today. This example uses an MPG3 pendant and a
C22 pendant interface card from CNC4PC connected to a second parallel
port plugged into the PCI slot. This example gives you 3 axes with 3
step increments of 0.1, 0.01, 0.001

In your custom.hal file or other.hal file add the following, making
sure you don't have mux4 or an encoder already in use. If you do just
increase the counts and change the reference number. More information
about mux4 and encoder can be found in the HAL manual.

# If your MPG outputs a quadrature signal per click set x4 to 1  
# If your MPG puts out 1 pulse per click set x4 to 0

# For velocity mode, set n to 1  
# In velocity mode the axis stops when the dial is stopped 
# even if that means the commanded motion is not completed,  
# For position mode (the default), set n to 0  
# In position mode the axis will move exactly jog-scale  
# units for each count, regardless of how long that might take,  
# This must be set for each axis you want in velocity mode
