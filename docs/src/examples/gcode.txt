= G Code Examples

After you install LinuxCNC several sample files are placed in the
/nc_files folder. Make sure the sample file is appropriate for your
machine before running.

== Mill Examples

=== Helical Hole Milling

File Name: useful-subroutines.ngc

Description: Subroutine for milling a hole using parameters.

=== Slotting

File Name: useful-subroutines.ngc

Description: Subroutine for milling a slot using parameters.

=== Grid Probe

File Name: gridprobe.ngc

Description: Rectangular Probing

This program repeatedly probes in a regular XY grid and writes the
probed location to the file 'probe-results.txt' in the same directory
as the .ini file.

=== Smart Probe

File Name: smartprobe.ngc

Description: Rectangular Probing

This program repeatedly probes in a regular XY grid and writes the
probed location to the file 'probe-results.txt' in the same directory
as the .ini file. This is improved from the grid probe file.

=== Tool Length Probe

File Name: tool-length-probe.ngc

Description: Tool Length Probing

This program shows an example of how to measure tool lengths
automatically using a switch hooked to the probe input. This is useful
for machines without tool holders, where the length of a tool is
different every time it is inserted.

=== Hole Probe

File Name: probe-hole.ngc

Description: Finding the Center and Diameter of a hole.

The program demonstrates how to find the center of a hole, measure the
hole diameter and record the results.

=== Cutter Compensation

To be added

== Lathe Examples

=== Threading

File Name lathe-g76.ngc

Description: Facing, threading and parting off.

This file shows an example of threading on a lathe using parameters.
