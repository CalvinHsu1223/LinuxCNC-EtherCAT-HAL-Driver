== Default Plane

When LinuxCNC's interpreter was first written, it was designed for mills.
That is why the default plane is XY (G17). A normal lathe only uses the
XZ plane (G18). To change the default plane place the following line in
the .ini file in the RS274NGC section.

----
RS274NGC_STARTUP_CODE = G18
----

The above can be overwritten in a g code program so always set important things
in the preamble of the g code file.

== INI Settings

The following .ini settings are needed for lathe mode in Axis in addition to
or replacing normal settings in the .ini file.

----
[DISPLAY]
DISPLAY = axis
LATHE = 1
[TRAJ]
AXES = 3
COORDINATES = X Z
[AXIS_0]
...
[AXIS_2]
...
