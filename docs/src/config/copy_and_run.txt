= Running LinuxCNC

[[cha:running-emc]] (((Running LinuxCNC)))

== Invoking LinuxCNC

After installation, LinuxCNC starts just like any other Linux program: 
run it from the terminal by issuing the command 'emc', 
or select it in the Applications - CNC menu.

== Configuration Selector

By default, the Configuration Selector dialog 
is shown when you first run LinuxCNC. 
Your own personalized configurations are shown at the top of the list, 
followed by sample configurations. 
Because each sample configuration is for a different type of hardware interface, 
almost all will not run without the hardware installed. 
The configurations listed under the category 'sim' run entirely 
without attached hardware.

Click any of the listed configurations 
to display specific information about it. 
Double-click a configuration or click OK 
to start the configuration. 
Select 'Create Desktop Shortcut' and then click OK 
to add an icon on the Ubuntu desktop 
to directly launch this configuration 
without showing the Configuration Selector screen. 

When you select a configuration from the Sample Configurations section, 
it will automaticly place a copy of that config in the
emc/configs directory. 

== Next steps in configuration

After finding the sample configuration that uses 
the same interface hardware as your machine, 
and saving a copy to your home directory, 
you can customize it according to the details of your machine. 
Refer to the Integrator Manual for topics on configuration.
