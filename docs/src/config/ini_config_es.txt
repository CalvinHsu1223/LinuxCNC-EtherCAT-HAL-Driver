== The INI File Components

A typical INI file follows a rather simple layout that includes;

* comments
* sections
* variables

Each of these elements is separated on single lines. Each end of line
or newline character creates a new element.

=== Comments (((Comments, INI File)))

A comment line is started with a ; or a # mark. When the ini reader
sees either of these marks at the start a line, the rest of the line is
ignored by the software. Comments can be used to describe what an INI
element will do.

----
; This is my mill configuration file.
# I set it up on January 12, 2012
----

Comments can also be used to 'turn off' a variable. This makes it easier
to pick between different variables.

----
DISPLAY = axis
# DISPLAY = touchy
----

In this list, the DISPLAY variable will be set to axis because the
other one is commented out. If someone carelessly edits a list like
this and leaves two of the lines uncommented, the first one encountered
will be used.

Note that inside a variable, the "#" and ";" characters do not denote
comments:

----
INCORRECT = value     # and a comment

# Correct Comment
CORRECT = value
----

=== Sections

Related parts of an ini file are separated into sections.
A section name is enclosed in brackets like this '[THIS_SECTION]'
The order of sections is unimportant. Sections begin at the section
name and end at the next section name.

The following sections are used by LinuxCNC:

* '[<<sub:[EMC]-section,EMC>>]' general information
* '[<<sub:[DISPLAY]-section,DISPLAY>>]' settings related to the graphical user interface
* '[<<sub:[FILTER]-Section,FILTER>>]' settings input filter programs
* '[<<sub:[RS274NGC]-section,RS274NGC>>]' settings used by the g-code interpreter
* '[<<sub:[EMCMOT]-section,EMCMOT>>]' settings used by the real time motion controller
* '[<<sub:[TASK]-section,TASK>>]' settings used by the task controller
* '[<<sub:[HAL]-section,HAL>>]' specifies .hal files
* '[<<sub:[HALUI]-section,HALUI>>]' MDI commands used by HALUI
* '[<<sub:[TRAJ]-section,TRAJ>>]' additional settings used by the real time motion controller
* '[<<sub:[AXIS]-section,AXIS_n>>]' individual axis variables
* '[<<sub:[EMCIO]-Section,EMCIO>>]' settings used by the I/O Controller

=== Variables

A variable line is made up of a variable name, an equals sign (=), and
a value. Everything from the first non-white space character after the
= up to the end of the line is passed as the value, so you can embed
spaces in string symbols if you want to or need to. A variable name is
often called a keyword.

The following sections detail each section of the configuration file,
using sample values for the configuration lines.

Variables that are used by LinuxCNC must always use the section
names and variable names as shown. In the following example the variable
'MACHINE' is assigned the value 'My Machine'.

.Variable Example
----
MACHINE = My Machine
----

=== Custom Sections and Variables [[sub:custom-variables]]

Most sample configurations use custom sections and variables to put all of the
settings into one location for convenience.

To use a custom section variable in your HAL file add the section and
variable to the INI file.

.Custom Section Example
----
[OFFSETS]
OFFSET_1 = 0.1234
----

To add a custom variable to a LinuxCNC section simply include the variable
in that section.

.Custom Variable Example
----
[AXIS_0]
TYPE = LINEAR
...
SCALE = 16000
----

To use the custom variables in your HAL file put the section and variable
name in place of the value. 

.HAL Example
----
setp offset.1.offset [OFFSETS]OFFSET_1
setp stepgen.0.position-scale [AXIS_0]SCALE
----

[NOTE]
The value stored in the variable must match the type specificied by the
component pin.

== INI File Sections[[sec:INI-Detail]]

=== [EMC] Section[[sub:[EMC]-section]]

(((EMC (inifile section))))

* 'VERSION = $Revision: 1.3 $' - The version number for the INI file. The value shown here looks odd
    because it is automatically updated when using the Revision Control
    System. It's a good idea to change this number each time you revise
    your file. If you want to edit this manually just change the number and
    leave the other tags alone. 

* 'MACHINE = My Controller' - This is the name of the controller, which is printed out at the top
    of most graphical interfaces. You can put whatever you want here as
    long as you make it a single line long.

* 'DEBUG = 0' - Debug level 0 means no messages will be printed when LinuxCNC is run from a
    terminal. Debug flags are usually only useful to developers. See
    src/emc/nml_intf/emcglb.h for other settings.

=== [DISPLAY] Section[[sub:[DISPLAY]-section]]

(((DISPLAY (inifile section))))

Different user interface programs use different options, and not every
option is supported by every user interface. The main two interfaces
for LinuxCNC are AXIS and Touchy. Axis is an interface for use with normal
computer and monitor, Touchy is for use with touch screens.
Descriptions of the interfaces are in the Interfaces section of the
User Manual.

* 'DISPLAY = axis' - The name of the user interface to use. Valid options
    may include: axis,(((axis))) touchy,(((touchy))) keystick,(((keystick)))
    mini,(((mini))) tklinuxcnc,(((tkLinuxCNC))) xemc,(((xemc)))

* 'POSITION_OFFSET = RELATIVE' - The coordinate system (RELATIVE or MACHINE) to show when the user
    interface starts. The RELATIVE coordinate system reflects the G92 and
    G5x coordinate offsets currently in effect.

* 'POSITION_FEEDBACK = ACTUAL' - The coordinate value (COMMANDED or ACTUAL) to show when the user
    interface starts. The COMMANDED position is the ideal position
    requested by LinuxCNC. The ACTUAL position is the feedback position of the
    motors.

* 'MAX_FEED_OVERRIDE = 1.2' - The maximum feed override the user may select. 1.2 means 120% of the
    programmed feed rate.

* 'MIN_SPINDLE_OVERRIDE = 0.5' - The minimum spindle override the user may select. 0.5 means 50% of the
    programmed spindle speed. (This is useful as it's dangerous to run a
    program with a too low spindle speed).

* 'MAX_SPINDLE_OVERRIDE = 1.0' - The maximum spindle override the user may select. 1.0 means 100% of
    the programmed spindle speed.

* 'PROGRAM_PREFIX = ~/emc2/nc_files' - The default location for g-code files
    and the location for user-defined M-codes. This location is searched for
    the file name before the subroutine path and user M path if specified
    in the [RS274NGC] section.

* 'INTRO_GRAPHIC = emc2.gif' - The image shown on the splash screen.

* 'INTRO_TIME = 5' - The maximum time to show the splash screen, in seconds.

* 'CYCLE_TIME = 0.05' - Cycle time in seconds that display will sleep between
   polls.

[NOTE]
The following [DISPLAY] items are for the AXIS interface only.

* 'DEFAULT_LINEAR_VELOCITY = .25' - The default velocity for linear jogs, in ,
   <<sub:traj-section,machine units>> per second.

* 'MIN_VELOCITY = .01' - The approximate lowest value the jog slider.

* 'MAX_LINEAR_VELOCITY = 1.0' - The maximum velocity for linear jogs, in machine units per second.

* 'MIN_LINEAR_VELOCITY = .01' - The approximate lowest value the jog slider.

* 'DEFAULT_ANGULAR_VELOCITY = .25' - The default velocity for angular jogs, in machine units per second.

* 'MIN_ANGULAR_VELOCITY = .01' - The approximate lowest value the jog slider.

* 'MAX_ANGULAR_VELOCITY = 1.0' - The maximum velocity for angular jogs, in machine units per second.

* 'INCREMENTS = 1 mm, .5 in, ...' - Defines the increments available for incremental jogs.
    The INCREMENTS can be used to override the default. 
    The values can be decimal numbers (e.g., 0.1000) or fractional numbers (e.g., 1/16),
    optionally followed by a unit (cm, mm, um, inch, in or mil).
    If a unit is not specified the machine unit is assumed.
    Metric and imperial distances may be mixed:
    INCREMENTS = 1 inch, 1 mil, 1 cm, 1 mm, 1 um is a valid entry.

* 'OPEN_FILE = /full/path/to/file.ngc' - The file to show in the preview plot when AXIS starts. Use
   a blank string "" and no file will be loaded at start up.

* 'EDITOR = gedit' - The editor to use when selecting File > Edit to edit the gcode 
    from the AXIS menu. This must be configured for this menu item to
    work. Another valid entry is gnome-terminal -e vim.

* 'TOOL_EDITOR = tooledit' - The editor to use when editing the tool table (for example by
    selecting "File > Edit tool table..." in Axis). Other valid
    entries are "gedit", "gnome-terminal -e vim", and "gvim".

* 'PYVCP = /filename.xml' - The PyVCP panel description file. See the PyVCP section for more
    information.

* 'LATHE = 1' - This displays in lathe mode with a top view and with Radius and
    Diameter on the DRO.

* 'GEOMETRY = XYZABCUVW' - Controls the preview and backplot of rotary motion. This item consists
    of a sequence of axis letters, optionally preceded by a "-" sign. Only
    axes defined in '[TRAJ]AXES' should be used. This sequence specifies
    the order in which the effect
    of each axis is applied, with a "-" inverting the sense of the
    rotation.
     The proper GEOMETRY string depends on the machine configuration and
    the kinematics used to control it. The example string GEOMETRY=XYZBCUVW
    is for a 5-axis machine where kinematics causes UVW to move in the
    coordinate system of the tool and XYZ to move in the coordinate system
    of the material. The order of the letters is important, because it
    expresses the order in which the different transformations are applied.
    For example rotating around C then B is different than rotating around
    B then C. Geometry has no effect without a rotary axis.

* 'ARCDIVISION = 64' - Set the quality of preview of arcs. Arcs are previewed by dividing
    them into a number of straight lines; a semicircle is divided into
    *ARCDIVISION* parts. Larger values give a more accurate preview, but
    take longer to
    load and result in a more sluggish display. Smaller values give a less
    accurate preview, but take less time to load and may result in a faster
    display. The default value of 64 means a circle of up to 3 inches will
    be displayed to within 1 mil (.03%).footnote:[In LinuxCNC 2.4 and earlier,
    the default value was 128.]

* 'MDI_HISTORY_FILE =' - The name of a local MDI history file. If this is not specified Axis
    will save the MDI history in *.axis_mdi_history* in the user's home
    directory. This is useful if you have multiple configurations on one
    computer.

[NOTE]
The following [DISPLAY] item is used by the TKLinuxCNC interface only.

* 'HELP_FILE = tklinucnc.txt' - Path to help file.

=== [FILTER] Section[[sub:[FILTER]-Section]]

(((ini [FILTER] Section)))

AXIS has the ability to send loaded files through a filter program.
This filter can do any desired task: Something as simple as making sure
the file ends with M2, or something as complicated as detecting whether
the input is a depth image, and generating g-code to mill the shape it
defines. The [FILTER] section of the ini file controls how filters
work. First, for each type of file, write a PROGRAM_EXTENSION line.
Then, specify the program to execute for each type of file. This
program is given the name of the input file as its first argument, and
must write RS274NGC code to standard output. This output is what will
be displayed in the text area, previewed in the display area, and
executed by LinuxCNC when Run.

* 'PROGRAM_EXTENSION = .extension Description'

If your post processor outputs files in all caps you might want to add
the following line:

* 'PROGRAM_EXTENSION = .NGC XYZ Post Processor'

The following lines add support for the image-to-gcode converter
included with LinuxCNC:

* 'PROGRAM_EXTENSION = .png,.gif,.jpg Greyscale Depth Image'
** 'png = image-to-gcode'
** 'gif = image-to-gcode'
** 'jpg = image-to-gcode'
    
It is also possible to specify an interpreter:

* 'PROGRAM_EXTENSION = .py Python Script'
** 'py = python'

In this way, any Python script can be opened, and its output is
treated as g-code. One such example script is available at
nc_files/holecircle.py. This script creates g-code for drilling a
series of holes along the circumference of a circle. Many more g-code
generators are on the LinuxCNC Wiki site
http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emcinfo.pl[http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emcinfo.pl].

If the environment variable AXIS_PROGRESS_BAR is set, then lines
written to stderr of the form

* 'FILTER_PROGRESS=%d'

sets the AXIS progress bar to the given percentage. This feature
should be used by any filter that runs for a long time.

=== [RS274NGC] Section[[sub:[RS274NGC]-section]]

(((RS274NGC (inifile section))))

* 'PARAMETER_FILE = myfile.var' -
    (((PARAMETER FILE))) The file located in the same directory as the ini
    file which contains the parameters used by the interpreter (saved
    between runs). 

* 'RS274NGC_STARTUP_CODE = G01 G17 G20 G40 G49 G64 P0.001 G80 G90 G92 G94 G97 G98' -
    (((RS274NGC STARTUP CODE))) A string of NC codes that the interpreter
    is initialized with. This is not a substitute for specifying modal
    g-codes at the top of each ngc file, because the modal codes of
    machines differ, and may be changed by g-code interpreted earlier in
    the session.

* 'SUBROUTINE_PATH = ncsubroutines:/tmp/testsubs:lathesubs:millsubs' -
    (((SUBROUTINE PATH))) Specifies a colon (:) separated list of up to 10
    directories to be searched when single-file subroutines are specified
    in gcode. These directories are searched after searching
    [DISPLAY]PROGRAM_PREFIX (if it is specified) and before searching
    [WIZARD]WIZARD_ROOT (if specified). The paths are searched in the order
    that they are listed. The first matching subroutine file
    found in the search is used. Directories are specified relative to the
    current directory for the inifile or as absolute paths. The list must
    contain no intervening whitespace.

* 'USER_M_PATH = myfuncs:/tmp/mcodes:experimentalmcodes' - (((USER M PATH)))
   Specifies a list of colon (:) separated directories for user defined
   functions. Directories are specified relative to the current directory
   for the inifile or as absolute paths. The list must contain no intervening
   whitespace.
+
A search is made for each possible user defined function, typically
(M100-M199). The search order is:
+
. [DISPLAY]PROGRAM_PREFIX (if specified)
. If [DISPLAY]PROGRAM_PREFIX is not specified, search the default location: nc_files
. Then search each directory in the list [RS274NGC]USER_M_PATH
+
The first executable M1xx found in the search is used for each M1xx.

* 'USER_DEFINED_FUNCTION_MAX_DIRS=5'. The maximum number of directories defined
   at compile time. 

[NOTE]
[WIZARD]WIZARD_ROOT is a valid search path but the Wizard has not been fully
implemented and the results of using it are unpredictable.


=== [EMCMOT] Section[[sub:[EMCMOT]-section]]

(((EMCMOT (inifile section))))

This section is a custom section and is not used by LinuxCNC directly. Most
configurations use values from this section to load the motion controller. For
more information on the motion controller see the <<sec:motion,Motion>>
Section.

* 'EMCMOT = motmod' - the motion controller name is typically used here.

* 'BASE_PERIOD = 50000' - the 'Base' task period in nanoseconds.

* 'SERVO_PERIOD = 1000000' - This is the "Servo" task period in nanoseconds.

* 'TRAJ_PERIOD = 100000' - This is the 'Trajectory Planner' task period in
  nanoseconds.
  
=== [TASK] Section[[sub:[TASK]-section]]

(((TASK (inifile section))))

* 'TASK = milltask' - 
    Specifies the name of the 'task' executable. The 'task' executable does various
    things, such as communicate with the UIs over NML, communicate with the
    realtime motion planner over non-HAL shared memory, and interpret gcode.
    Currently there is only one task executable that makes sense for
    99.9% of users, milltask.
    
* 'CYCLE_TIME = 0.010' -
    The period, in seconds, at which TASK will run. This parameter
    affects the polling interval when waiting for motion to complete, when
    executing a pause instruction, and when accepting a command from a user
    interface. There is usually no need to change this number.

=== [HAL] section[[sub:[HAL]-section]]

(((HAL (inifile section))))

* 'TWOPASS=ON' - Use two pass processing for loading HAL comps. With TWOPASS processing,
    all [HAL]HALFILES are first read and multiple appearances of loadrt
    directives for each moduleb are accumulated.
    No hal commands are executed in this initial pass.

* 'HALFILE = example.hal' - Execute the file 'example.hal' at start up.
   If 'HALFILE' is specified multiple times, the files are executed in the order they
    appear in the ini file. Almost all configurations will have at least
    one 'HALFILE', and stepper systems typically have two such files, one
    which
    specifies the generic stepper configuration ('core_stepper.hal') and
    one which specifies the machine pin out ('xxx_pinout.hal')

* 'HALCMD = command' - Execute 'command' as a single HAL command.
   If 'HALCMD' is specified multiple times, the commands are executed in the order
    they appear in the ini file. 'HALCMD' lines are executed after all
    'HALFILE' lines.

* 'SHUTDOWN = shutdown.hal' - Execute the file 'shutdown.hal' when LinuxCNC is exiting.
   Depending on the hardware drivers used, this may make it possible to set outputs to
    defined values when LinuxCNC is exited normally. However, because there is
    no guarantee this file will be executed (for instance, in the case of a
    computer crash) it is not a replacement for a proper physical e-stop
    chain or other protections against software failure.

* 'POSTGUI_HALFILE = example2.hal' - (Only with the TOUCHY and AXIS GUI)
   Execute 'example2.hal' after the GUI has created its HAL pins. See
   section <<sec:pyvcp-with-axis,pyVCP with Axis>> Section for more information.

* 'HALUI = halui' - adds the HAL user interface pins. For more information see
   the <<cha:hal-user-interface,HAL User Interface>> chapter.

=== [HALUI] section[[sub:[HALUI]-section]]

(((HALUI (inifile section))))

* 'MDI_COMMAND = G53 G0 X0 Y0 Z0' - 
     An MDI command can be executed by using halui.mdi-command-00. Increment
    the number for each command listed in the [HALUI] section.

=== [TRAJ] Section [[sub:traj-section]]

(((TRAJ (inifile section))))

The [TRAJ] section contains general parameters for the trajectory
planning module in 'motion'.

* 'COORDINATES = X Y Z' - The names of the axes being controlled.
   Only X, Y, Z, A, B, C, U, V, W are valid. Only axes named in 'COORDINATES'
   are accepted in g-code. This has no effect on the mapping from G-code
    axis names (X- Y- Z-) to joint numbers--for 'trivial kinematics', X is
    always joint 0, A is always joint 4, and U is always joint 7, and so
    on. It is permitted to write an axis name twice (e.g., X Y Y Z for a
    gantry machine) but this has no effect.

* 'AXES = 3' - One more than the number of the highest joint number in the system.
    For an XYZ machine, the joints are numbered 0, 1 and 2; in this case
    AXES should be 3. For an XYUV machine using 'trivial kinematics', the V
    joint is numbered 7 and therefore AXES should be 8. For a machine with
    nontrivial kinematics (e.g., scarakins) this will generally be the
    number of controlled joints.

* 'JOINTS = 3' - (This config variable is used by the Axis GUI only,
    not by the trajectory planner in the motion controller.)  Specifies
    the number of joints (motors) in the system.  For example, an XYZ
    machine with a single motor for each axis has 3 joints.  A gantry
    machine with one motor on each of two of the axes, and two motors
    on the third axis, has 4 joints.

* 'HOME = 0 0 0' - Coordinates of the homed position of each axis. Again
    for a fourth
    axis you will need 0 0 0 0. This value is only used for machines with
    nontrivial kinematics. On machines with trivial kinematics this value
    is ignored.

* 'LINEAR_UNITS = <units>' - (((LINEAR UNITS))) Specifies the 'machine units' for linear axes.
    Possible choices are (in, inch, imperial, metric, mm).
     This does not affect the linear units in NC code (the G20 and G21
    words do this). 

* 'ANGULAR_UNITS = <units>' - (((ANGULAR UNITS))) Specifies the 'machine units' for rotational axes.
    Possible choices are 'deg', 'degree' (360 per circle), 'rad', 'radian'
    (2pi per circle), 'grad', or 'gon' (400 per circle).
     This does not affect the angular units of NC code. In RS274NGC, A-, B-
    and C- words are always expressed in degrees.

* 'DEFAULT_VELOCITY = 0.0167' - The initial rate for jogs of linear axes, in 
  machine units per second. The value shown in 'Axis' equals
  machine units per minute.

* 'DEFAULT_ACCELERATION = 2.0' - In machines with nontrivial kinematics, the acceleration used
    for "teleop" (Cartesian space) jogs, in 'machine units' per second per second.

* 'MAX_VELOCITY = 5.0' - (((MAX VELOCITY))) The maximum velocity for any axis or coordinated
    move, in 'machine units' per second. The value shown equals 300 units per
    minute.

* 'MAX_ACCELERATION = 20.0' - (((MAX ACCELERATION))) The maximum acceleration for any axis or
    coordinated axis move, in 'machine units' per second per second.

* 'POSITION_FILE = position.txt' - If set to a non-empty value, the joint positions are stored between
    runs in this file. This allows the machine to start with the same
    coordinates it had on shutdown. This assumes there was no movement of
    the machine while powered off. If unset, joint positions are not stored
    and will begin at 0 each time LinuxCNC is started. This can help on smaller
    machines without home switches.

* 'NO_FORCE_HOMING = 1' - The default behavior is for LinuxCNC to force the user to home the machine
    before any MDI command or a program is run. Normally jogging only is
    allowed before homing. Setting NO_FORCE_HOMING = 1 allows the user to
    make MDI moves and run programs without homing the machine first.
    Interfaces without homing ability will need to have this option set to 1.

[WARNING]
Using this will allow the machine to go beyond the soft limits
while in operation. It is not generally desirable to allow this.

=== [AXIS_<num>] Section[[sub:[AXIS]-section]]

(((AXIS (inifile section))))

The [AXIS_0], [AXIS_1], etc. sections contains general parameters for
the individual components in the axis control module. The axis section
names begin numbering at 0, and run through the number of axes
specified in the [TRAJ] AXES entry minus 1.

Typically (but not always):

* AXIS_0 = X
* AXIS_1 = Y
* AXIS_2 = Z
* AXIS_3 = A
* AXIS_4 = B
* AXIS_5 = C
* AXIS_6 = U
* AXIS_7 = V
* AXIS_8 = W

* 'TYPE = LINEAR' -
    The type of axes, either LINEAR or ANGULAR.

* 'WRAPPED_ROTARY = 1' - 
     When this is set to 1 for an ANGULAR axis the axis will move 0-359.999
    degrees. Positive Numbers will move the axis in a positive direction and
    negative numbers will move the axis in the negative direction.

* 'LOCKING_INDEXER = 1' - When this is set to 1 a G0 move for this axis will
    initiate an unlock with axis.N.unlock pin then wait for the
    axis.N.is-unlocked pin then move the axis at the rapid rate for that axis.
    After the move the axis.N.unlock will be false and motion will wait for
    axis.N.is-unlocked to go false. Moving with other axes is not allowed when
    moving a locked rotary axis.

* 'UNITS = INCH' -
    (((UNITS))) If specified, this setting overrides the related [TRAJ] UNITS setting.
    (e.g., [TRAJ]LINEAR_UNITS if the TYPE of this axis is LINEAR,
    [TRAJ]ANGULAR_UNITS if the TYPE of this axis is ANGULAR)

* 'MAX_VELOCITY = 1.2' -
    Maximum velocity for this axis in <<sub:traj-section,machine units>> per second.

* 'MAX_ACCELERATION = 20.0' -
     Maximum acceleration for this axis in machine units per
    second squared.

* 'BACKLASH = 0.0000' -
    (((Backlash))) Backlash in machine units. Backlash compensation value
    can be used to make up for small deficiencies in the hardware used to
    drive an axis. If backlash is added to an axis and you are using
    steppers the STEPGEN_MAXACCEL must be increased to 1.5 to 2 times the
    MAX_ACCELERATION for the axis.

* 'COMP_FILE = file.extension' -
    (((Compensation))) A file holding compensation structure for the axis.
    The file could be named xscrew.comp, for example, for the X axis. File
    names are case sensitive and can contain letters and/or numbers. The
    values are triplets per line separated by a space. The first value is
    nominal (where it should be). The second and third values depend on the
    setting of COMP_FILE_TYPE. Currently the limit inside LinuxCNC is for 256
    triplets per axis. If COMP_FILE is specified, BACKLASH is ignored.
    Compensation file values are in machine units.

* 'COMP_FILE_TYPE = 0 or 1' -
** 'If 0:' The second and third values specify
    the forward position (where the axis is while traveling forward) and
    the reverse position (where the axis is while traveling reverse),
    positions which correspond to the nominal position.'
** 'If 1:' The second and third values specify
    the forward trim (how far from nominal while traveling forward) and
    the reverse trim (how far from nominal while traveling in reverse),
    positions which correspond to the nominal position.

    Example triplet with COMP_FILE_TYPE = 0: 1.00 1.01 0.99 +
    Example triplet with COMP_FILE_TYPE = 1: 1.00 0.01 -0.01

* 'MIN_LIMIT = -1000' -
    (((MIN LIMIT))) The minimum limit (soft limit) for axis motion, in machine units.
    When this limit is exceeded, the controller aborts axis motion.

* 'MAX_LIMIT = 1000' -
    (((MAX LIMIT))) The maximum limit (soft limit) for axis motion, in machine units.
    When this limit is exceeded, the controller aborts axis motion.

* 'MIN_FERROR = 0.010' -
    (((MIN FERROR))) This is the value in machine units by which the axis is permitted to
    deviate from commanded position at very low speeds. If MIN_FERROR is
    smaller than FERROR, the two produce a ramp of error trip points. You
    could think of this as a graph where one dimension is speed and the
    other is permitted following error. As speed increases the amount of
    following error also increases toward the FERROR value.

* 'FERROR = 1.0' -
    (((FERROR))) FERROR is the maximum allowable following error, in machine units.
    If the difference between commanded and sensed position exceeds this
    amount, the controller disables servo calculations, sets all the
    outputs to 0.0, and disables the amplifiers. If MIN_FERROR is present
    in the .ini file, velocity-proportional following errors are used.
    Here, the maximum allowable following error is proportional to the
    speed, with FERROR applying to the rapid rate set by
    [TRAJ]MAX_VELOCITY, and proportionally smaller following errors for
    slower speeds. The maximum allowable following error will always be
    greater than MIN_FERROR. This prevents small following errors for
    stationary axes from inadvertently aborting motion. Small following
    errors will always be present due to vibration, etc. The following
    polarity values determine how inputs are interpreted and how outputs
    are applied. They can usually be set via trial-and-error since there
    are only two possibilities. The LinuxCNC Servo Axis Calibration utility
    program (in the AXIS interface menu Machine/Calibration and in TkLinuxCNC it
    is under Setting/Calibration) can be used to set these and more
    interactively and verify their results so that the proper values can be
    put in the INI file with a minimum of trouble.

==== Homing[[sub:Homing-related-items]]

These parameters are Homing related, for a better explanation read the
<<cha:homing-configuration,Homing Configuration>> Chapter.

* 'HOME = 0.0' -
     The position that the joint will go to upon completion of the homing
    sequence.

* 'HOME_OFFSET = 0.0' -
     The axis position of the home switch or index pulse, in
    <<sub:traj-section,machine units>>. In other words, when the home point is found during
    the homing process, this is the value or position that should be
    assigned to the home point, or initialized at the home point.

* 'HOME_SEARCH_VEL = 0.0' -
    (((HOME SEARCH VEL))) Initial homing velocity in machine units per second.
    Sign denotes direction of travel. A value of zero means assume that the current
    location is the home position for the machine. If your machine has no
    home switches you will want to leave this value at zero.

* 'HOME_LATCH_VEL = 0.0' -
     Homing velocity in machine units per second to the home
    switch latch position. Sign denotes direction of travel.

* 'HOME_FINAL_VEL = 0.0' -
     Velocity in machine units per second from home latch position to home
    position. If left at 0 or not included in the axis rapid velocity is
    used. Must be a positive number.

* 'HOME_USE_INDEX = NO' -
     If the encoder used for this axis has an index pulse, and
    the motion
    card has provision for this signal you may set it to yes. When it is
    yes, it will affect the kind of home pattern used. Currently, you can't
    home to index with steppers unless you're using stepgen in velocity mode
    and PID.

* 'HOME_IGNORE_LIMITS = NO' -
     Some machines use a single switch per axis as a home switch 
    and limit switch. This variable should be set to YES if the machine 
    configured this way. When set to YES the limit switch for this axis
    only is ignored when homing.

* 'HOME_IS_SHARED = <n>' -
     If the home input is shared by more than one axis set <n> to 1 to
    prevent homing from starting if the one of the shared switches is
    already closed. Set <n> to 0 to permit homing if a switch is closed.

* 'HOME_SEQUENCE = <n>' -
     Used to define the "Home All" sequence. <n> starts at 0 and no numbers
    may be skipped. If left out or set to -1 the joint will not be homed by
    the "Home All" function. More than one axis can be homed at the same
    time.

* 'VOLATILE_HOME = 0' -
     When enabled (set to 1) this joint will be unhomed if the Machine
    Power is off or if E-Stop is on. This is useful if your machine has
    home switches and does not have position feedback such as a step and
    direction driven machine.

// NOTICE this stuff belongs in the PID section

[WARNING]
The following are custom INI file entries that you may find in a sample INI file
or a wizard generated file. These are not used by the LinuxCNC software. They
are only there to put all the settings in one place. For more information on
custom INI file entries see the
<<sub:custom-variables,Custom Sections and Variables>> subsection.

The following items might be used by a PID component and the assumption is
that the output is volts.

* 'DEADBAND = 0.000015' - How close is close enough to consider the motor in position,
in <<sub:traj-section,machine units>>. This is often set to a distance equivalent to 1, 1.5, 2,
or 3 encoder counts, but there are no strict rules.
Looser (larger) settings allow less servo 'hunting' at the expense of lower accuracy.
Tighter (smaller) settings attempt higher accuracy at the expense of more servo 'hunting'.
Is it really more accurate if it's also more uncertain?
As a general rule, it's good to avoid, or at least limit, servo 'hunting' if you can.

Be careful about going below 1 encoder count, since you may create a condition where
there is no place that your servo is happy. This can go beyond 'hunting' (slow) to
'nervous' (rapid), and even to 'squealing' which is easy to confuse with
oscillation caused by improper tuning. Better to be a count or two loose
here at first, until you've been through 'gross tuning' at least.

Example of calculating machine units per encoder pulse to use in deciding DEADBAND value:

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
latexmath:[ \frac{X\, inches}{1\, encoder\, count} =
\frac{1\, revolution}{1000\, encoder\, lines} \times
\frac{1\, encoder\, line}{4\, quadrature\, counts} \times
\frac{0.200\, inches}{1\, revolution} =
\frac{0.200\, inches}{4000\, encoder\, counts} =
\frac{0.000050\, inches}{1\, encoder\, count} ]
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

* 'BIAS = 0.000' - This is used by hm2-servo and some others.
    Bias is a constant amount
    that is added to the output. In most cases it should be left at zero.
    However, it can sometimes be useful to compensate for offsets in servo
    amplifiers, or to balance the weight of an object that moves
    vertically. bias is turned off when the PID loop is disabled, just like
    all other components of the output.

* 'P = 50' - The proportional gain for the axis servo. This value
    multiplies the
    error between commanded and actual position in machine units, resulting
    in a contribution to the computed voltage for the motor amplifier. The
    units on the P gain are volts per machine unit, e.g.,
    image:images/p-term.png[height=25]

//latexmath:[$\frac{volt}{mu}$]. 

* 'I = 0' - The integral gain for the axis servo. The value
    multiplies the
    cumulative error between commanded and actual position in machine
    units, resulting in a contribution to the computed voltage for the
    motor amplifier. The units on the I gain are volts per machine unit
    second, e.g., image:images/i-term.png[height=25]
    
//latexmath:[$\frac{volt}{mu\, s}$].

* 'D = 0' - The derivative gain for the axis servo. The value
    multiplies the
    difference between the current and previous errors, resulting in a
    contribution to the computed voltage for the motor amplifier. The units
    on the D gain are volts per machine unit per second, e.g.,
    image:images/i-term.png[height=25]

// latexmath:[$\frac{volt}{mu/s}$].

* 'FF0 = 0' - The 0th order feed forward gain. This number is
    multiplied by the
    commanded position, resulting in a contribution to the computed voltage
    for the motor amplifier. The units on the FF0 gain are volts per
    machine unit, e.g., image:images/p-term.png[height=25]

// latexmath:[$\frac{volt}{mu}$].

* 'FF1 = 0' - The 1st order feed forward gain. This number is
    multiplied by the
    change in commanded position per second, resulting in a contribution to
    the computed voltage for the motor amplifier. The units on the FF1 gain
    are volts per machine unit per second, e.g., image:images/i-term.png[height=25]

// latexmath:[$\frac{volt}{mu\, s}$].

* 'FF2 = 0' - The 2nd order feed forward gain. This number is
    multiplied by the
    change in commanded position per second per second, resulting in a
    contribution to the computed voltage for the motor amplifier. The units
    on the FF2 gain are volts per machine unit per second per second,
    e.g., image:images/ff2.png[height=25]
    
// latexmath:[$\frac{volt}{mu\, s^{2}}$].

* 'OUTPUT_SCALE = 1.000' -

* 'OUTPUT_OFFSET = 0.000' - These two values are the scale and offset factors for
    the axis output to the motor amplifiers.
    The second value (offset) is subtracted from
    the computed output (in volts), and divided by the first value (scale
    factor), before being written to the D/A converters. The units on the
    scale value are in true volts per DAC output volts. The units on the
    offset value are in volts. These can be used to linearize a DAC.
     Specifically, when writing outputs, the LinuxCNC first converts the desired
    output in quasi-SI units to raw actuator values, e.g., volts for an
    amplifier DAC. This scaling
    looks like: image:images/output-offset.png[]
    
// latexmath:[raw=\frac{output-offset}{scale}]

The value for scale can be obtained analytically by doing a unit
analysis, i.e., units are [output SI units]/[actuator units]. For
example, on a machine with a velocity mode amplifier such that
1 volt results in 250 mm/sec velocity.

image::images/scale-math.png[align="center"]

// latexmath:[$ amplifier [volts] = (output [\frac{mm}{sec}]
// - offset [\frac{mm}{sec}]) / 250 \frac{mm}{sec\, volt} ] $]

Note that the units of the offset are in machine units, e.g.,
mm/sec, and they are pre-subtracted from the sensor readings. The value
for this offset is obtained by finding the value of your output which
yields 0.0 for the actuator output. If the DAC is linearized, this
offset is normally 0.0.

The scale and offset can be used to linearize the DAC as well,
resulting in values that reflect the combined effects of amplifier
gain, DAC non-linearity, DAC units, etc.

To do this, follow this procedure.

. Build a calibration table for the output, driving the DAC with a
   desired voltage and measuring the result.
   
. Do a least-squares linear fit to get coefficients a, b such
   that image:images/calibration-1.png[]
. Note that we want raw output such that our measured result is
   identical to the commanded output. This means 
.. image:images/calibration-2.png[]
.. image:images/calibration-3.png[]
. As a result, the a and b coefficients from the linear fit can be
   used as the scale and offset for the controller directly. 

See the following table for an example of voltage measurements.

// latexmath:[ cmd=a*raw+b ]
// latexmath:[ raw=(cmd-b)/a ]

* 'MAX_OUTPUT = 10' - The maximum value for the output of the PID compensation
    that is written to the motor amplifier, in volts. The computed
    output value is clamped to this limit. The limit is applied before
    scaling to raw output units. The value is applied symmetrically to
    both the plus and the minus side.

* 'INPUT_SCALE = 20000' - in Sample configs
* 'ENCODER_SCALE = 20000' - in PNCconf built configs
Specifies the number of pulses that
corresponds to a move of one machine unit as set in the [TRAJ] section.
For a linear axis one machine unit will be equal to
the setting of LINEAR_UNITS.
For an angular axis one unit is equal to the setting in ANGULAR_UNITS.
A second number, if specified, is ignored.
For example, on a 2000 counts per rev encoder(((encoder))), and 10
revs/inch gearing, and desired units of inch, we
have:

image::images/encoder-scale.png[align="center"]

//latexmath:[ INPUT\_SCALE =
//\frac{2000\, counts}{rev} \times \frac{10\, rev}{inch} =
//\frac{20000\, counts}{inch} ]

[WARNING]
The following are custom INI file entries that you may find in a sample INI file
or a wizard generated file. These are not used by the LinuxCNC software. They
are only there to put all the settings in one place. For more information on
custom INI file entries see the
<<sub:custom-variables,Custom Sections and Variables>> subsection.

The following items might be used by a stepgen component.

* 'SCALE = 4000' - in Sample configs
* 'STEP_SCALE = 4000' - in PNCconf built configs
Specifies the number of pulses that corresponds to a
move of one machine unit as set in the [TRAJ] section.
For stepper systems, this is
the number of step pulses issued per machine unit. For a linear axis
one machine unit will be equal to the setting of LINEAR_UNITS. For an
angular axis one unit is equal to the setting in ANGULAR_UNITS. For
servo systems, this is the number of feedback pulses per machine unit.
A second number, if specified, is ignored.

For example, on a 1.8 degree stepper motor with half-stepping, and 10
revs/inch gearing, and desired <<sub:traj-section,machine units>> of inch, we
have:

image::images/stepper-scale.png[align="center"]

//latexmath:[ scale = 
//\frac{2\, steps}{1.8\, degree} \times \frac{360\, degree}{rev} \times \frac{10\, rev}{inch} =
//\frac{4000\, steps}{inch} ]

* 'ENCODER_SCALE = 20000' (Optionally used in PNCconf built configs) -
Specifies the number of pulses that
corresponds to a move of one machine unit as set in the [TRAJ] section.
For a linear axis one machine unit will be equal to
the setting of LINEAR_UNITS.
For an angular axis one unit is equal to the setting in ANGULAR_UNITS.
A second number, if specified, is ignored.
For example, on a 2000 counts per rev encoder(((encoder))), and 10
revs/inch gearing, and desired units of inch, we
have:

//latexmath:[ ENCODER\_SCALE =
//\frac{2000\, counts}{rev} \times \frac{10\, rev}{inch} =
//\frac{20000\, counts}{inch} ]


* 'STEPGEN_MAXACCEL = 21.0' -  Acceleration limit for the step generator.
    This should be 1% to 10%
    larger than the axis MAX_ACCELERATION. This value improves the tuning
    of stepgen's "position loop". If you have added backlash compensation
    to an axis then this should be 1.5 to 2 times greater than
    MAX_ACCELERATION.

* 'STEPGEN_MAXVEL = 1.4' - Older configuration files have a velocity limit for
    the step
    generator as well. If specified, it should also be 1% to 10% larger
    than the axis MAX_VELOCITY. Subsequent testing has shown that use of
    STEPGEN_MAXVEL does not improve the tuning of stepgen's position loop.

=== [EMCIO] Section[[sub:[EMCIO]-Section]]

(((EMCIO (inifile section))))

* 'CYCLE_TIME = 0.100' -
    The period, in seconds, at which EMCIO will run. Making
    it 0.0 or a
    negative number will tell EMCIO not to sleep at all. There is usually
    no need to change this number.

* 'TOOL_TABLE = tool.tbl' -
    The file which contains tool information, described in
    the User Manual.

* 'TOOL_CHANGE_POSITION = 0 0 2' -
    Specifies the XYZ location to move to when performing a
    tool change if three digits are used.
    Specifies the XYZABC location when 6 digits are used.
    Specifies the XYZABCUVW location when 9 digits are used.
    Tool Changes can be combined. For example if you combine the
    quill up with change position you can move the Z first then the X and Y.

* 'TOOL_CHANGE_WITH_SPINDLE_ON = 1' -
    The spindle will be left on during the tool change when the value is 1.
    Useful for lathes or machines where the material is in the spindle,
    not the tool.

* 'TOOL_CHANGE_QUILL_UP = 1' -
    The Z axis will be moved to machine zero prior to the tool change when
    the value is 1. This is the same as issuing a G0 G53 Z0.

* 'TOOL_CHANGE_AT_G30 = 1' -
    The machine is moved to reference point defined by parameters
    5181-5186 for G30 if the value is 1. For more information on G30 and
    Parameters see the G Code Manual.

* 'RANDOM_TOOLCHANGER = 1' -
    This is for machines that cannot place the tool back into the pocket
    it came from. For example, machines that exchange the tool in the
    active pocket with the tool in the spindle.
