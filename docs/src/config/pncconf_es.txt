PNCconf is made to help build configurations that utilize specific Mesa 
'Anything I/O' products. 

It can configure closed loop servo systems or hardware stepper systems.
It uses a similar 'wizard' approach as Stepconf (used for software stepping, 
parallel port driven systems).

PNCconf is still in a development stage (Beta) so there are some bugs and
 lacking features.
Please report bugs and suggestions to the LinuxCNC forum page or mail-list.

There are two trains of thought when using PNCconf:

One is to use PNCconf to always configure your system - if you decide to change 
options, reload PNCconf and allow it to configure the new options. This will 
work well if your machine is fairly standard and you can use custom files to add
 non standard features. PNCconf tries to work with you in this regard.

The other is to use PNCconf to build a config that is close to what you want and
 then hand edit everything to tailor it to your needs. This would be the choice 
if you need extensive modifications beyond PNCconf's scope or just want to 
tinker with / learn about LinuxCNC

You navigate the wizard pages with the forward, back, and cancel buttons there 
is also a help button that gives some help information about the pages, diagrams
 and an output page.

TIP: PNCconf's help page should have the most up to date info and has additional
 details.

Step by Step Instructions
=========================

.PnCConf Splash

== Create or Edit

This allows you to select a previously saved configuration or create a new one.
If you pick 'Modify a configuration' and then press next a file selection box 
will show. Pncconf preselects your last saved file. Choose the the config you 
wish to edit. It also allows you to select desktop shortcut / launcher options.
A desktop shortcut will place a folder icon on the desktop that points to your 
new configuration files. Otherwise you would have to look in your home folder 
under emc2/configs.

A Desktop launcher will add an icon to the desktop for starting your config 
directly. You can also launch it under Applications/cnc/emc2 and selecting your
config name.

== Basic Machine Information

.PnCConf Basic

image::images/pncconf-basic.png[]

Machine Basics::
If you use a name with spaces PNCconf will replace the spaces with underscore 
(as a loose rule Linux doesn't like spaces in names)
Pick an axis configuration - this selects what type of machine you are building 
and what axes are available. The Machine units selector allows data entry of 
metric or imperial units in the following pages.

TIP: Defaults are not converted when using metric so make sure they are sane 
values!

Computer Response Time::

The servo period sets the heart beat of the system. Latency refers to the amount
of time the computer can be longer then that period. Just like a railroad, LinuxCNC
requires everything on a very tight and consistent time line or bad things 
happen. LinuxCNC requires and uses a 'real time' operating system, which just means 
it has a low latency ( lateness ) response time when LinuxCNC requires its 
calculations and when doing LinuxCNCs calculations it cannot be interrupted by lower
priority requests (such as user input to screen buttons or drawing etc).
+
Testing the latency is very important and a key thing to check early. Luckily by
using the Mesa card to do the work that requires the fastest response time 
(encoder counting and PWM generation) we can endure a lot more latency then if 
we used the parallel port for these things. The standard test in LinuxCNC is checking
the BASE period latency (even though we are not using a base period). If you 
press the 'test base period jitter' button, this launches the latency test 
window ( you can also load this directly from the applications/cnc panel ). The 
test mentions to run it for a few minutes but the longer the better. consider 15
minutes a bare minimum and overnight even better. At this time use the computer
to load things, use the net, use USB etc we want to know the worst case 
latency and to find out if any particular activity hurts our latency. We need to
look at base period jitter.
Anything under 20000 is excellent - you could even do fast software stepping 
with the machine
20000 - 50000 is still good for software stepping and fine for us.
50000 - 100000 is really not that great but could still be used with hardware 
cards doing the fast response stuff.
So anything under 100000 is useable to us.
If the latency is disappointing or you get a bad hiccup periodically you may 
still be able to improve it. 

TIP: There is a user compiled list of equipment and the 
latency obtained on the LinuxCNC wiki :
http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emcinfo.pl?Latency-Test
Please consider adding your info to the list. Also on that page are links to 
info about fixing some latency problems. 

Now we are happy with the latency and 
must pick a servo period. In most cases a servo period of 1000000 ns is
fine ( that gives a 1 kHz servo calculation rate - 1000 calculations a second) 
if you are building a closed loop servo system that controls torque (current) 
rather then velocity (voltage) a faster rate would be better - something like 
200000 (5 kHz calculation rate). The problem with lowering the servo rate is 
that it leaves less time available for the computer to do other things besides 
LinuxCNC's calculations. Typically the display (GUI) becomes less responsive. You
 must decide on a balance. Keep in mind that if you tune your closed loop servo
system then change the servo period you probably will need to tune them again.
 
I/O Control Ports/Boards::
PNCconf is capable of configuring machines that have up to two Mesa boards and 
three parallel ports. Parallel ports can only be used for simple low speed 
(servo rate) I/O.

Mesa::
You must choose at least one Mesa board as PNCconf will not configure the 
parallel ports to count encoders or output step or PWM signals.
The mesa cards available in the selection box are based on what PNCconf finds 
for firmware on the systems. There are options to add custom firmware and/or 
'blacklist' (ignore) some firmware or boards using a preference file.
If no firmware is found PNCconf will show a warning and use internal sample 
firmware - no testing will be possible. One point to note is that if you choose 
two PCI Mesa cards there currently is no way to predict which card is 0 and 
which is 1 - you must test - moving the cards could change their order. If you 
configure with two cards both cards must be installed for tests to function.

Parallel Port::
Up to 3 parallel ports (referred to as parports) can be used as simple I/O. You 
must set the address of the parport. You can either enter the Linux parallel 
port numbering system (0,1,or 2) or enter the actual address. The address for an
 on board parport is often 0x0278 or 0x0378 (written in hexadecimal) but can be 
found in the BIOS page. The BIOS page is found when you first start your 
computer you must press a key to enter it (such as F2). On the BIOS page you can
 find the parallel port address and set the mode such as SPP, EPP, etc on some
computers this info is displayed for a few seconds during start up. For PCI 
parallel port cards the address can be found by pressing the 'parport address 
search' button. This pops up the help output page with a list of all the PCI 
devices that can be found. In there should be a reference to a parallel port 
device with a list of addresses. One of those addresses should work. Not all
PCI parallel ports work properly. Either type can be selected as 'in' (maximum 
amount of input pins) or 'out' (maximum amount of output pins)

GUI Frontend list::
This specifies the graphical display screens LinuxCNC will use.
Each one has different option. 

AXIS

* fully supports lathes.
* is the most developed and used frontend
* is designed to be used with mouse and keyboard
* is tkinter based so integrates PYVCP (python based virtual control 
                panels)  naturally.
* has a 3D graphical window.
* allows VCP integrated on the side or in center tab

TOUCHY

* Touchy was designed to be used with a touchscreen, some minimal 
                physical switches and a MPG wheel.
* requires cycle-start, abort, and single-step signals and buttons
* It also requires shared axis MPG jogging to be selected.  
* is GTK based so integrates GLADE VCP (virtual control panels) naturally.
* allows VCP panels integrated in the center Tab
* has no graphical window
* look can be changed with custom themes

MINI

* standard on OEM Sherline machines
* does not use Estop
* no VCP integration

TkLinuxCNC

* hi contrast bright blue screen   
* separate graphics window
* no VCP integration

== External Configuration

This page allows you to select external controls such as for jogging or 
overrides.

.GUI External

image::images/pncconf-external.png[]

If you select a Joystick for jogging, You will need it always connected for LinuxCNC 
to load. To use the analog sticks for useful jogging you probably need to add 
some custom HAL code. MPG jogging requires a pulse generator connected to a MESA
 encoder counter. Override controls can either use a pulse generator (MPG) or 
switches (such as a rotary dial). External buttons might be used with a switch 
based OEM joystick.

Joystick jogging:: 
Requires a custom 'device rule' to be installed in the system. This is a file 
that LinuxCNC uses to connect to LINUX's device list. PNCconf will help to make this 
file.
+
'Search for device rule' will search the system for rules, you can use this to 
find the name of devices you have already built with PNCconf.
+
'Add a device rule' will allow you to configure a new device by following the 
prompts. You will need your device available.
+
'test device' allows you to load a device, see its pin names and check its 
functions with halmeter.
+
joystick jogging uses HALUI and hal_input components.

External buttons:: 
allows jogging the axis with simple buttons at a specified jog rate. Probably 
best for rapid jogging.

MPG Jogging::
Allows you to use a Manual Pulse Generator to jog the machine's axis.
+
MPG's are often found on commercial grade machines. They output quadrature 
pulses that can be counted with a MESA encoder counter. PNCconf allows for an 
MPG per axis or one MPG shared with all axis. It allows for selection of jog 
speeds using switches or a single speed.
+
The selectable increments option uses the mux16 component. This component
has options such as debounce and gray code to help filter the raw switch input. 

Overrides::
PNCconf allows overrides of feedrates and/or spindle speed using a pulse 
generator (MPG) or switches (eg. rotary).  
 
== GUI Configuration

Here you can set defaults for the display screens, add virtual control panels 
(VCP), and set some LinuxCNC options..

.GUI Configuration

image::images/pncconf-gui.png[]

Frontend GUI Options::

The default options allows general defaults to be chosen for any display screen.
+
AXIS defaults are options specific to AXIS. If you choose size , position or 
force maximize options then PNCconf will ask if it's alright to overwrite a 
preference file (.axisrc). Unless you have manually added commands to this file 
it is fine to allow it. Position and force max can be used to move AXIS to a 
second monitor if the system is capable.
+
Touchy defaults are options specific to Touchy. Most of Touchy's options can be 
changed while Touchy is running using the preference page. Touchy uses GTK to 
draw its screen, and GTK supports themes. Themes controls the basic look and 
feel of a program. You can download themes from the net or edit them yourself. 
There are a list of the current themes on the computer that you can pick from.
To help some of the text to stand out PNCconf allows you to override the 
Themes's defaults. The position and force max options can be used to move Touchy
to a second monitor if the system is capable.

VCP options::

Virtual Control Panels allow one to add custom controls and displays to the 
screen. AXIS and Touchy can integrate these controls inside the screen in 
designated positions. There are two kinds of VCPs -
pyVCP which uses 'Tkinter' to draw the screen and GLADE VCP that uses 'GTK' to 
draw the screen.

PyVCP::
PyVCPs screen XML file can only be hand built. PyVCPs fit naturally in with AXIS
as they both use TKinter.
+
HAL pins are created for the user to connect to inside their custom HAL file.
There is a sample spindle display panel for the user to use as-is or build on.
You may select a blank file that you can later add your controls 'widgets' to 
or select a spindle display sample that will display spindle speed and indicate 
if the spindle is at requested speed.
+
PNCconf will connect the proper spindle display HAL pins for you.
If you are using AXIS then the panel will be integrated on the right side.
If not using AXIS then the panel will be separate 'stand-alone' from the 
frontend screen.
+
You can use the geometry options to size and move the panel, for instance to 
move it to a second screen if the system is capable. If you press the 'Display 
sample panel' button the size and placement options will be honoured.

GLADE VCP::
GLADE VCPs fit naturally inside of TOUCHY screen as they both use GTK to draw 
them, but by changing GLADE VCP's theme it can be made to blend pretty well in 
AXIS. (try Redmond)
+
It uses a graphical editor to build its XML files.
HAL pins are created for the user to connect to, inside of their custom HAL 
file.
+
GLADE VCP also allows much more sophisticated (and complicated) programming 
interaction, which PNCconf currently doesn't leverage. (see GLADE VCP in the 
manual)
+
PNCconf has sample panels for the user to use as-is or build on.
With GLADE VCP PNCconf will allow you to select different options on your
sample display.
+
Under 'sample options' select which ones you would like.
The zero buttons use HALUI commands which you could edit later in the HALUI 
section.
+
Auto Z touch-off also requires the classicladder touch-off program and a probe 
input selected. It requires a conductive touch-off plate and a grounded 
conductive tool. For an idea on how it works see:
+
http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emcinfo.pl?ClassicLadderExamples#Single_button_probe_touchoff 
+
Under 'Display Options', size, position, and force max can be used on a 
'stand-alone' panel for such things as placing the screen on a second monitor if
the system is capable.
+
You can select a GTK theme which sets the  basic look and feel of the panel.
You Usually want this to match the frontend screen.
These options will be used if you press the 'Display sample button'.
With GLADE VCP depending on the frontend screen, you can select where the panel 
will display.
+
You can force it to be stand-alone or with AXIS it can be in the center or on 
the right side, with Touchy it can be in the center.

Defaults and Options::

*  Require homing before MDI / Running
** If you want to be able to move the machine before homing uncheck 
                this checkbox.

*  Popup Tool Prompt
** Choose between an on screen prompt for tool changes or export standard signal
   names for a User supplied custom tool changer Hal file

*  Leave spindle on during tool change: 
** Used for lathes

*  Force individual manual homing

*  Move spindle up before tool change

* Restore joint position after shutdown
** Used for non-trivial kinematics machines

* Random position toolchangers
** Used for toolchangers that do not return the tool to the same
  pocket. You will need to add custom HAL code to support toolchangers.

== Mesa Configuration
The Mesa configuration pages allow one to utilize different firmwares.
On the basic page you selected a Mesa card here you pick the available firmware
and select what and how many components are available.

.Mesa Configuration

image::images/pncconf-mesa-config.png[]

Parport address is used only with Mesa parport card, the 7i43. An onboard 
parallel port usually uses 0x278 or 0x378 though you should be able to find the 
address from the BIOS page. The 7i43 requires the parallel port to use the EPP 
mode, again set in the BIOS page. If using a PCI parallel port the address can 
be searched for by using the search button on the basic page.

[NOTE]
Many PCI cards do not support the EPP protocol properly.

PDM PWM and 3PWM base frequency sets the balance between ripple and linearity. 
If using Mesa daughter boards the docs for the board should give recommendations

[IMPORTANT] 
It's important to follow these to avoid damage and get the best performance.

....
The 7i33 requires PDM and a PDM base frequency of 6 mHz
The 7i29 requires PWM and a PWM base frequency of 20 Khz
The 7i30 requires PWM and a PWM base frequency of 20 Khz
The 7i40 requires PWM and a PWM base frequency of 50 Khz
The 7i48 requires UDM and a PWM base frequency of 24 Khz
....

Watchdog time out is used to set how long the MESA board will wait before 
killing outputs if communication is interrupted from the computer. Please 
remember Mesa uses 'active low' outputs meaning that when the output pin is on, 
it is low (approx 0 volts) and if it's off the output in high (approx 5 volts) 
make sure your equipment is safe when in the off (watchdog bitten) state.

You may choose the number of available components by deselecting unused ones. 
Not all component types are available with all firmware.

Choosing less then the maximum number of components allows one to gain more GPIO
 pins. If using daughter boards keep in mind you must not deselect pins that the
 card uses. For instance some firmware supports two 7i33 cards, If you only have
 one you may deselect enough components to utilize the connector that supported 
the second 7i33. Components are deselected numerically by the highest number
first then down with out skipping a number. If by doing this the components are 
not where you want them then you must use a different firmware. The firmware 
dictates where, what and the max amounts of the components. Custom firmware is 
possible, ask nicely when contacting the LinuxCNC developers and Mesa. Using custom 
firmware in PNCconf requires special procedures and is not always possible - 
Though I try to make PNCconf as flexible as possible.

After choosing all these options press the 'Accept Component Changes' button and
 PNCconf will update the I/O setup pages. Only I/O tabs will be shown for 
available connectors, depending on the Mesa board.


== Mesa I/O Setup
The tabs are used to configure the input and output pins of the Mesa boards.
PNCconf allows one to create custom signal names for use in custom HAL files.

.Mesa I/O C2

image::images/pncconf-mesa-io2.png[]

On this tab with this firmware the components are setup for a 7i33 daughter 
board, usually used with closed loop servos. Note the component numbers of the 
encoder counters and PWM drivers are not in numerical order. This follows the 
daughter board requirements.

.Mesa I/O C3

image::images/pncconf-mesa-io3.png[]

On this tab all the pins are GPIO. Note the 3 digit numbers - they will match 
the HAL pin number. GPIO pins can be selected as input or output and can be 
inverted.

.Mesa I/O C4

image::images/pncconf-mesa-io4.png[]

On this tab there are a mix of step generators and GPIO.
Step generators output and direction pins can be inverted. Note that inverting a
 Step Gen-A pin (the step output pin) changes the step timing. It should match 
what your controller expects.

== Parport configuration

image::images/pncconf-parport.png[]

The parallel port can be used for simple I/O similar to Mesa's GPIO pins.

== Axis Configuration

.Axis Drive Configuration

image::images/pncconf-axis-drive.png[]

This page allows configuring and testing of the motor and/or encoder combination
. If using a servo motor an open loop test is available, if using a stepper a 
tuning test is available.

Open Loop Test::
An open loop test is important as it confirms the direction of the motor and 
encoder. The motor should move the axis in the positive direction when the 
positive button is pushed and also the encoder should count in the postie 
direction. The axis movement should follow the Machinery's Handbook 
footnote:["axis nomenclature" in the chapter "Numerical Control" in the 
"Machinery's Handbook" published by Industrial Press.] standards or 
AXIS graphical display will not make much sense. Hopefully the help page and 
diagrams can help figure this out. Note that axis directions are based on TOOL 
movement not table movement. There is no acceleration ramping with the open loop
 test so start with lower DAC numbers. By moving the axis a known distance one 
can confirm the encoder scaling. The encoder should count even without the amp 
enabled depending on how power is supplied to the encoder. 
+
WARNING: If the motor and encoder do not agree on counting direction then the 
servo will run away when using PID control.
+
Since at the moment PID settings can not be tested in PNCconf the settings are 
really for when you re-edit a config - enter your tested PID settings.
+
DAC scaling, max output and offset are used to tailor the DAC output.

Compute DAC::
These two values are the scale and offset factors for the axis output to the 
motor amplifiers. The second value (offset) is subtracted from the computed 
output (in volts), and divided by the first value (scale factor), before being 
written to the D/A converters. The units on the scale value are in true volts 
per DAC output volts. The units on the offset value are in volts. These can be 
used to linearize a DAC.
+
Specifically, when writing outputs, the LinuxCNC first converts the desired 
output in quasi-SI units to raw actuator values, e.g., volts for an amplifier
 DAC. This scaling looks like: The value for scale can be obtained analytically 
by doing a unit analysis, i.e., units are [output SI units]/[actuator units]. 
For example, on a machine with a velocity mode amplifier such that 1 volt 
results in 250 mm/sec velocity, Note that the units of the offset are in machine
 units, e.g., mm/sec, and they are pre-subtracted from the sensor readings. The 
value for this offset is obtained by finding the value of your output which 
yields 0.0 for the actuator output. If the DAC is linearized, this offset is 
normally 0.0.
+
The scale and offset can be used to linearize the DAC as well, resulting in 
values that reflect the combined effects of amplifier gain, DAC non-linearity, 
DAC units, etc. To do this, follow this procedure:

* Build a calibration table for the output, driving the DAC with a 
            desired voltage and measuring the result:

.Output Voltage Measurements

[cols="^,^",width="50%"]
|==================
|*Raw* | *Measured*
|-10 | *-9.93*
| -9 | *-8.83*
|  0 | *-0.96*
|  1 | *-0.03*
|  9 | *9.87*
| 10 | *10.07*
|==================


* Do a least-squares linear fit to get coefficients a, b such that meas=a*raw+b
* Note that we want raw output such that our measured result is 
            identical to the commanded output. This means
** cmd=a*raw+b
** raw=(cmd-b)/a
* As a result, the a and b coefficients from the linear fit can be used 
            as the scale and offset for the controller directly. 

MAX OUTPUT:
The maximum value for the output of the PID compensation that is written to the 
motor amplifier, in volts. The computed output value is clamped to this limit. 
The limit is applied before scaling to raw output units. The value is applied 
symmetrically to both the plus and the minus side.

*Tuning Test*
The tuning test unfortunately only works with stepper based systems. Again 
confirm the directions on the axis is correct. Then test the system by running
 the axis back and forth, If the acceleration or max speed is too high you will 
lose steps. While jogging, Keep in mind it can take a while for an axis with low
acceleration to stop. Limit switches are not functional during this test. You 
can set a pause time so each end of the test movement. This would allow you to 
set up and read a dial indicator to see if you are loosing steps.

*Stepper Timing*
Stepper timing needs to be tailored to the step controller's requirements. 
Pncconf supplies some default controller timing or allows custom timing settings
. See http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emcinfo.pl?Stepper_Drive_Timing for
some more known timing numbers (feel free to add ones you have figured out). If 
in doubt use large numbers such as 5000 this will only limit max speed.

*Brushless Motor Control*
These options are used to allow low level control of brushless motors using 
special firmware and daughter boards. It also allows conversion of HALL sensors 
from one manufacturer to another. It is only partially supported and will 
require one to finish the HAL connections. Contact the mail-list or forum for 
more help.

.Axis Scale Calculation

image::images/pncconf-scale-calc.png[]

The scale settings can be directly entered or one can use the 'calculate scale' 
button to assist. Use the check boxes to select appropriate calculations. Note 
that 'pulley teeth' requires the number of teeth not the gear ratio. Worm turn 
ratio is just the opposite it requires the gear ratio. If your happy with the 
scale press apply otherwise push cancel and enter the scale directly.
 

.Axis Configuration

image::images/pncconf-axis-config.png[]

Also refer to the diagram tab for two examples of
home and limit switches. These are two examples of
many different ways to set homing and limits.

IMPORTANT: It is very important to start with the axis moving in the right 
direction or else getting homing right is very difficult!

Remember positive and negative directions
refer to the TOOL not the table as per the Machinists handbook.

.On a typical knee or bed mill
* when the TABLE moves out that is the positive Y direction
* when the TABLE moves left that is the positive X direction
* when the TABLE moves down that is the positive Z direction
* when the HEAD moves up that is the positive Z direction

.On a typical lathe
* when the TOOL moves right, away from the chuck
* that is the positive Z direction
* when the TOOL moves toward the operator
* that is the positive X direction. Some lathes have X 
* opposite (eg tool on back side), that will work fine but 
* AXIS graphical display can not be made to reflect this. 

When using homing and / or limit switches
LinuxCNC expects the HAL signals to be true when 
the switch is being pressed / tripped.
If the signal is wrong for a limit switch then
LinuxCNC will think the machine is on end of limit
all the time. If the home switch search logic is wrong
LinuxCNC will seem to home in the wrong direction.
What it actually is doing is trying to BACK off 
the home switch.


Decide on limit switch location.

Limit switches are the back up for software limits in case
something electrical goes wrong eg. servo runaway.
Limit switches should be placed so that the machine does not
hit the physical end of the axis movement. Remember the axis
will coast past the contact point if moving fast. Limit switches
should be 'active low' on the machine. eg. power runs through
the switches all the time - a loss of power (open switch) trips.
While one could wire them the other way, this is fail safe.
This may need to be inverted so that the HAL signal in LinuxCNC
in 'active high' - a TRUE means the switch was tripped. When
starting LinuxCNC if you get an on-limit warning, and axis is NOT
tripping the switch, inverting the signal is probably the
solution. (use HALMETER to check the corresponding HAL signal  
eg. axis.0.pos-lim-sw-in  X axis positive limit switch)

Decide on the home switch location.

If you are using limit switches You may as well use one as a
home switch. A separate home switch is useful if you have a long
axis that in use is usually a long way from the limit switches or
moving the axis to the ends presents problems of interference 
with material.
eg a long shaft in a lathe makes it hard to home to limits with out 
the tool hitting the shaft, so a separate home switch closer to the 
middle may be better.
If you have an encoder with index then the home switch acts as a 
course home and the index will be the actual home location.

Decide on the MACHINE ORIGIN position.

MACHINE ORIGIN is what LinuxCNC uses to reference all user coordinate
systems from.
I can think of little reason it would need to be in any particular
spot. There are only a few G codes that can access the 
MACHINE COORDINATE system.( G53, G30 and G28 )
If using tool-change-at-G30 option having the Origin at the tool
change position may be convenient. By convention, it may be easiest
to have the ORIGIN at the home switch.

Decide on the (final) HOME POSITION.

this just places the carriage at a consistent and convenient position 
after LinuxCNC figures out where the ORIGIN is.

Measure / calculate the positive / negative axis travel distances.

Move the axis to the origin. Mark a reference on the movable
slide and the non-moveable support (so they are in line) move 
the machine to the end of limits. Measure between the marks that is one 
of the travel distances. Move the table to the other end of travel.
Measure the marks again. That is the other travel distance. If the ORIGIN
is at one of the limits then that travel distance will be zero.

(machine) ORIGIN::
    The Origin is the MACHINE zero point. (not
    the zero point you set your cutter / material at).
    LinuxCNC uses this point to reference everything else
    from. It should be inside the software limits.
    LinuxCNC uses the home switch location to calculate 
    the origin position (when using home switches
    or must be manually set if not using home switches.

Travel distance::
    This is the maximum distance the axis can
    travel in each direction. This may
    or may not be able to be measured directly
    from origin to limit switch. The positive and
    negative travel distances should add up to the
    total travel distance.
  
POSITIVE TRAVEL DISTANCE::
    This is the distance the Axis travels from 
    the Origin to the positive travel distance or
    the total travel minus the negative travel 
    distance. You would set this to zero if the
    origin is positioned at the positive limit.
    The will always be zero or a positive number.

NEGATIVE TRAVEL DISTANCE::
    This is the distance the Axis travels from 
    the Origin to the negative travel distance.
    or the total travel minus the positive travel 
    distance. You would set this to zero if the
    origin is positioned at the negative limit.
    This will always be zero or a negative number.
    If you forget to make this negative PNCconf
    will do it internally.

(Final) HOME POSITION::
    This is the position the home sequence will
    finish at. It is referenced from the Origin
    so can be negative or positive depending on
    what side of the Origin it is located.
    When at the (final) home position if
    you must move in the Positive direction to
    get to the Origin, then the number will be 
    negative.

HOME SWITCH LOCATION::
    This is the distance from the home switch to 
    the Origin. It could be negative or positive
    depending on what side of the Origin it is
    located. When at the home switch location if
    you must move in the Positive direction to
    get to the Origin, then the number will be 
    negative. If you set this to zero then the
    Origin will be at the location of the limit
    switch (plus distance to find index if used) 
    
Home Search Velocity::
    Course home search velocity in units per minute.
   
Home Search Direction::
    Sets the home switch search direction
    either negative (ie. towards negative limit switch)
    or positive (ie. towards positive limit switch)

Home Latch Velocity::
    Fine Home search velocity in units per minute

Home Final Velocity::
    Velocity used from latch position to (final) home position
    in units per minute. Set to 0 for max rapid speed 

Home latch Direction::
    Allows setting of the latch direction to the same
    or opposite of the search direction.

Use Encoder Index For Home::
    LinuxCNC will search for an encoder index pulse while in
    the latch stage of homing.

Use Compensation File::
    Allows specifying a Comp filename and type.
    Allows sophisticated compensation. See Manual.

Use Backlash Compensation::
    Allows setting of simple backlash compensation. Can 
    not be used with Compensation File. See Manual.

.AXIS Help Diagram

image::images/pncconf-diagram-lathe.png[]

The diagrams should help to demonstrate an example of limit switches and 
standard axis movement directions.
In this example the Z axis was two limit switches, the positive switch is shared
 as a home switch.
The MACHINE ORIGIN (zero point) is located at the negative limit.
The left edge of the carriage is the negative trip pin and the right the 
positive trip pin.
We wish the FINAL HOME POSITION to be 4 inches away from the ORIGIN on the 
positive side.
If the carriage was moved to the positive limit we would measure 10 inches 
between the negative limit and the negative trip pin.

== Spindle Configuration

If you select spindle signals then this page is available to configure spindle 
control.

TIP: Many of the option on this page will not show unless the proper option was 
selected on previous pages!

.Spindle Configuration

image::images/pncconf-spindle-config.png[]

This page is similar to the axis motor configuration page.

There are some differences:

* Unless one has chosen a stepper driven spindle there is no acceleration or 
velocity limiting.
* There is no support for gear changes or ranges.
* If you picked a VCP spindle display option then spindle-at-speed scale and 
filter settings may be shown.
* Spindle-at-speed allows LinuxCNC to wait till the spindle is at the requested speed 
before moving the axis. This is particularly handy on lathes with constant 
surface feed and large speed diameter changes. It requires either encoder 
feedback or a digital spindle-at-speed signal typically connected to a VFD 
drive.
* If using encoder feedback, you may select a spindle-at-speed scale setting that 
specifies how close the actual speed must be to the requested speed to be 
considered at-speed.
* If using encoder feedback, the VCP speed display can be erratic - the 
filter setting can be used to smooth out the display. The encoder scale must be 
set for the encoder count / gearing used.
* If you are using a single input for a spindle encoder you must add the line:
setp    hm2_7i43.0.encoder.00.counter-mode 1
(changing the board name and encoder number to your requirements) into a custom 
HAL file. See the Hostmot2 section on encoders for more info about counter mode.

 

== Advanced Options

This allows setting of HALUI commands and loading of classicladder and sample 
ladder programs.
If you selected GLADE VCP options such as for zeroing axis, there will be 
commands showing.
See the manual about info on HALUI for using custom halcmds.
There are several ladder program options.
The Estop program allows an external ESTOP switch or the GUI frontend to throw 
an Estop. It also has a timed lube pump signal.
The Z auto touch-off is with a touch-off plate, the GLADE VCP touch-off button 
and special HALUI commands to set the current
user origin to zero and rapid clear.
The serial modbus program is basically a blank template program that sets up 
classicladder for serial modbus. See the classicladder section in the manual.

== HAL Components

On this page you can add additional HAL components you might need for custom 
HAL files.
In this way one should not have to hand edit the main HAL file, while still 
allowing user needed components.

.HAL Components

image::images/pncconf-hal.png[]

The first selection is components that pncconf uses internally.
You may configure pncconf to load extra instances of the components for your 
custom HAL file.

Select the number of instances your custom file will need, pncconf will add 
what it needs after them.

Meaning if you need 2 and pncconf needs 1 pncconf will load 3 instances and use 
the last one.

Custom Component Commands::

This selection will allow you to load HAL components that pncconf does not use.
Add the loadrt or loadusr command, under the heading 'loading command'
Add the addf command under the heading 'Thread command'.
The components will be added to the thread between reading of inputs and writing
of outputs, in the order you write them in the 'thread command'.

== Advanced Usage Of PNCconf

PNCconf does its best to allow flexible customization by the user.
PNCconf has support for custom signal names, custom loading of components, 
custom HAL files and custom firmware.

There are also signal names that PNCconf always provides regardless of options 
selected, for user's custom HAL files
With some thought most customizations should work regardless if you later select
different options in PNCconf.

Eventually if the customizations are beyond the scope of PNCconf's frame work 
you can use PNCconf to build a base config or use one of LinuxCNC's sample 
configurations and just hand edit it to what ever you want.

Custom Signal Names::

If you wish to connect a component to something in a custom HAL file write a 
unique signal name in the combo entry box. Certain components will add endings 
to your custom signal name:

Encoders will add < customname > +:

* position
* count
* velocity
* index-enable
* reset

Steppers add:

* enable
* counts
* position-cmd
* position-fb
* velocity-fb

PWM add:

* enable
* value

GPIO pins will just have the entered signal name connected to it

In this way one can connect to these signals in the custom HAL files and still 
have the option to move them around later.

Custom Signal Names::

The Hal Components page can be used to load components needed by a user for 
customization.

Loading Custom Firmware::

PNCconf searches for firmware on the system and then looks for the XML file that
it can convert to what it understands. These XML files are only supplied for 
officially released firmware from the LinuxCNC team. To utilize custom firmware one 
must convert it to an array that PNCconf understands and add its filepath
to PNCconf's preference file. By default this path searches the desktop for
a folder named custom_firmware and a file named firmware.py.

The hidden preference file is in the user's home file, is 
named .pncconf-preferences and require one to select 'show hidden files' to see 
and edit it. The contents of this file can be seen when you first load PNCconf - 
press the help button and look at the output page.

Ask on the LinuxCNC mail-list or forum for info about converting custom firmware. 
Not all firmware can be utilized with PNCconf.

Custom HAL Files::

There are four custom files that you can use to add HAL commands to:

* custom.hal is for HAL commands that don't have to be run after the GUI frontend
loads. It is run after the configuration-named HAL file.
* custom_postgui.hal is for commands that must be run after AXIS loads or a 
standalone PYVCP display loads.
* custom_gvcp.hal is for commands that must be run after glade VCP is loaded.
* shutdown.hal is for commands to run when LinuxCNC shuts down in a controlled manner.
