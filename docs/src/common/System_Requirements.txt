== Minimum Requirements (((Minimum Requirements)))

The minimum system to run LinuxCNC and Ubuntu may vary depending on the
exact usage. Stepper systems in general require faster threads to
generate step pulses than servo systems. Using the Live-CD you can test
the software before committing a computer. Keep in mind that the
Latency Test numbers are more important than the processor speed for
software step generation. More information on the Latency Test is 
<<latency-test,here>>.

Additional information is on the LinuxCNC Wiki site:

http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emcinfo.pl?Hardware_Requirements[Wiki.LinuxCNC.org, Hardware_Requirements]

LinuxCNC and Ubuntu should run reasonably well on a computer with the
following minimum hardware specification. These numbers are not the
absolute minimum but will give reasonable performance for most stepper
systems.

* 700 MHz x86 processor (1.2 GHz x86 processor recommended)
* 384 MB of RAM (512 MB up to 1 GB recommended)
* 8 GB hard disk
* Graphics card capable of at least 1024x768 resolution, which is not
   using the NVidia or ATI fglrx proprietary drivers, and which is not an
   onboard video chipset that shares main memory with the CPU
* A network or Internet connection (not strictly needed, but very useful
   for updates and for communicating with the LinuxCNC community)

Minimum hardware requirements change as Ubuntu evolves so check the 
https://help.ubuntu.com[Ubuntu] web site for details on the LiveCD your using.
Older hardware may benefit from selecting an older version of the LiveCD when
available.

== Problematic Hardware

=== Laptops

Laptops are not generally suited to real time software step
generation. Again a Latency Test run for an extended time will give you
the info you need to determine suitability.

=== Video Cards

If your installation pops up with 800 x 600 screen resolution then
most likely Ubuntu does not recognize your video card or monitor.
Onboard video many times causes bad real time performance.
