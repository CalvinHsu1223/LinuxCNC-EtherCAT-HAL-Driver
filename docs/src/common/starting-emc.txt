== Running LinuxCNC

LinuxCNC is started with the script file 'linuxcnc'.

----
linuxcnc [options] [<ini-file>]
----

.linuxcnc script options
* '-v' = verbose - prints info as it works
* '-d' = echoes script commands to screen for debugging

If the linuxcnc script is passed an ini file it reads the ini file and starts
LinuxCNC. The ini file [HAL] section specifies the order of loading up HAL
files if more than one is used. Once the HAL=xxx.hal files are loaded then the
GUI is loaded then the POSTGUI=.xxx.hal file is loaded. If you create PyVCP or
GladeVCP objects with HAL pins you must use the postgui HAL file to make any
connections to those pins. See the <<sub:[HAL]-section,HAL>> section of the
INI configuration for more information.

=== [[sub:configuration-selector]] Configuration Selector

If no ini file is passed to the linuxcnc script it loads the configuration 
selector so you can choose and save a sample configuration. Once a sample
configuration has been saved it can be modified to suit your application.

== Files Used for Configuration

LinuxCNC is configured with human readable text files. All of these
files can be read and edited in any of the common text file editors
available with most any Linux distribution.footnote:[Don't confuse a
text editor with a word processor. A text editor like
gedit or kwrite produce files that are plain text. They also produce
lines of text that are separated from each other. A word processor like
Libre Office produces files with paragraphs and word wrapping and lots of
embedded codes that control font size and such. A text editor does none
of this.] You'll need to be a bit careful when you edit these files. Some
mistakes will cause the start up to fail. These files are read whenever
the software starts up. Some of them are read repeatedly while the CNC
is running.

Configuration files include

* 'INI' (((INI))) The ini file overrides defaults that are compiled into the
    LinuxCNC code. It also provides sections that are read directly by the
    Hardware Abstraction Layer.

* 'HAL' (((HAL))) The HAL files start up process modules and provide linkages
    between LinuxCNC signals and specific hardware pins.

* 'VAR' (((VAR))) The var file is a way for the interpreter to save some
    values from one run to the next. These values are saved from one run to
    another but not always saved immediately. See the Parameters section of
    the G Code Manual for information on what each parameter is.

* 'TBL' (((TBL))) The tbl file saves tool information. See the User Manual
    Tool File section for more info.

* 'NML' (((NML))) The nml file configures the communication channels used by
    the LinuxCNC. It is normally setup to run all of the communication within a
    single computer but can be modified to communicate between several
    computers.

* 'linuxcncrc' (((.linuxcncrc))) This file saves user specific information and is created
    to save the name of the directory when the user first selects an LinuxCNC
    configuration.footnote:[Usually this file is in the users home
    directory (e.g. /home/user/ )]

Items marked *(in HAL)* are used by the sample HAL files and are 
suggested as a good convention. 
Other items are used by LinuxCNC directly, and must always have 
the section and item names given. 

== TWOPASS

LinuxCNC 2.5 supports TWOPASS processing of hal configuration files
that can help in the modularization and readability of hal files.
(Hal files are specified in an LinuxCNC ini file in the HAL stanza 
as [HAL]HALFILE=filename).

Normally, a set of one or more hal configuration files must use
a single, unique loadrt line to load a kernel module that may
handle multiple instances of a component.  For example, if you
use a two input AND gate component (and2) in three different
places in your setup, you would need to have a single line
somewhere to specify:

----
   loadrt and2 count=3
----

resulting in components and2.0, and2.1, and2.2.

Configurations are more readable if you specify with the
names=option for components where it is supported, e.g.,:

----
loadrt and2 names=aa,ab,ac
----

resulting in components aa,ab,ac.

It can be a maintenance problem to keep track of the components
and their names since when you add (or remove) a component, you
must find and update the single loadrt directive applicable to
the component.

TWOPASS processing is enabled by including an ini file parameter:

----
[HAL]TWOPASS=anything
----

Where "anything" can be any non-null string.
With this setting, you can have multiple specifications like:

----
loadrt and2 names=aa
...
loadrt and2 names=ab,ac
...
loadrt and2 names=ad
----

These commands can appear in different HALFILES.  The HALFILES
are processed in the order of their appearance in the ini file.

With TWOPASS processing, all [HAL]HALFILES are first read and
multiple appearances of loadrt directives for each module are
accumulated.  No hal commands are executed in this initial pass.

After the initial pass, the modules are loaded automatically
with a number equal to the total number when using the count=
option or with all of the individual names specified when using
the names= option.

A second pass is then made to execute all of the other hal
instructions specified in the HALFILES.  The addf commands that
associate a component's functions with thread execution are
executed in the order of appearance with other commands during
this second pass.

While you can use either the count= or names= options, they are
mutually exclusive -- only one type can  be specified for a
given module.

TWOPASS processing is most effective when using the names=
option.  This option allows you to provide unique names that
are mnemonic or otherwise relevant to the configuration.   For
example, if you use a derivative component to estimate the
velocities and accelerations on each (x,y,z) coordinate, using
the count= method will give arcane component names like ddt.0,
ddt.1, ddt.2, etc.

Alternatively, using the names= option like:

----
loadrt ddt names=xvel,yvel,zvel
...
loadrt ddt names=xacel,yacel,zacel
----

results in components sensibly named xvel,yvel,zvel, xacel,yacel,zacel.

Many comps supplied with the distribution are created with the
comp utility and support the names= option.  These include the
common logic components that are the glue of many hal configurations.

User-created comps that use the comp utility automatically
support the names= option as well.  In addition to comps generated
with the comp utility, numerous other comps support the names=option.
Comps that support names= option include: at_pid, encoder,
encoder_ratio, pid, siggen, and sim_encoder.

Examples of TWOPASS usage for a simulator are included in the
configs/simtcl directory.
