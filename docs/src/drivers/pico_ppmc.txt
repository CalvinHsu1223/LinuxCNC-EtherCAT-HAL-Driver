= Pico Drivers

[[cha:pico-drivers]] (((Pico PPMC Driver)))

Pico Systems has a family of boards for doing analog servo, stepper,
and PWM (digital) servo control. The boards connect to the PC through a
parallel port working in EPP mode. Although most users connect one
board to a parallel port, in theory any mix of up to 8 or 16 boards can
be used on a single parport. One driver serves all types of boards. The
final mix of I/O depends on the connected board(s). The driver doesn't
distinguish between boards, it simply numbers I/O channels (encoders,
etc) starting from 0 on the first board.  The driver is named hal_ppmc.ko
The analog servo interface is also called the PPMC for Parallel Port Motion
Control.  There is also the Universal Stepper Controller, abbreviated the
USC.  And the Universal PWM Controller, or UPC.

Installing:
----
loadrt hal_ppmc port_addr=<addr1>[,<addr2>[,<addr3>...]]
----

The 'port_addr' parameter tells the driver what parallel port(s) to 
check. By default, '<addr1>' is 0x0378, and '<addr2>' and following 
are not used. The driver searches the entire address 
space of the enhanced parallel port(s) at 'port_addr', looking for 
any board(s) in the PPMC family. It then exports HAL 
pins for whatever it finds. During loading (or attempted loading) the 
driver prints some useful debugging messages to the kernel log, which 
can be viewed with 'dmesg'. 

Up to 3 parport busses may be used, and each bus may have up to 8 (or
possibly 16 PPMC) devices on it.

== Command Line Options

There are several options that can be specified on the loadrt command line.
First, the USC and UPC can have an 8-bit DAC added for spindle speed
control and similar functions.  This can be specified with the
extradac='0xnn[,0xmm]' parameter.  The part enclosed in [ ] allows you
to specify this option on more than one board of the system.  The first
hex digit tells which EPP bus is being referred to, it corresponds to
the order of the port addresses in the port_addr parameter, where
<addr1> would be zero here.  So, for the first EPP bus, the first
USC or UPC board would be described as '0x00', the second USC or UPC
on the same bus would be '0x02'.  (Note that each USC or UPC takes up
two addresses, so if one is at 00, the next would have to be 02.)

Alternatively, the 8 digital output pins can be used as additional
digital outputs, it works the same way as above with the syntax :
extradout=0xnn'.  The extradac and extradout options are mutually
exclusive on each board, you can only specify one.

The UPC and PPMC encoder boards can timestamp the arrival of encoder
counts to refine the derivation of axis velocity.  This derived velocity
can be fed to the PID hal component to produce smoother D term
response.  The syntax is : timestamp='0xnn[,0xmm]', this works the
same way as above to select which board is being configured.
Default is to not enable the timestamp option.  If you put
this option on the command line, it enables the option.  The
first 'n' selects the EPP bus, the second one matches the
address of the board having the option enabled.  The driver checks the
revision level of the board to make sure it has firmware supporting
the feature, and produces an error message if the board does not
support it.

The PPMC encoder board has an option to select the encoder digital
filter frequeency.  (The UPC has the same ability via DIP switches
on the board.)  Since the PPMC encoder board doesn't have these
extra DIP switches, it needs to be selected via a command-line
option.  By default, the filter runs at 1 MHz, allowing encoders
to be counted up to about 900 KHz (depending on noise and quadrature
accuracy of the encoder.)  The options are 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 MHz.
These are set with a parameter of 1,2,5 and 10 (decimal) which
is specified as the hex digit "A".  These are specified in a manner
similar to the above options, but with the frequency setting to
the left of the bus/address digits.  So, to set 5 MHz on the
encoder board at address 3 on the first EPP bus, you would write :
enc_clock='0x503'

== Pins

In the following pins, parameters, and functions, <port> is the parallel
port ID. According to the naming conventions the first port should always
have an ID of zero.  All the boards have some method of setting the
address on the EPP bus.  USC and UPC have simple provisions for only
two addresses, but jumper foil cuts allow up to 4 boards to be addressed.
The PPMC boards have 16 possible addresses.  In all cases, the driver
enumerates the boards by type and exports the appropriate HAL pins.
For instance, the encoders will be enumerated from zero up, in the
same order as the address switches on the board specify.  So, the first
board will have encoders 0 -- 3, the second board would have encoders
4 -- 7.
The first column after the bullet tells which boards will have this
HAL pin or parameter associated with it.  All means that this pin is
available on all three board types.  Option means that this pin
will only be exported when that option is enabled by an optional
parameter in the loadrt HAL command.  These options require the
board to have a sufficient revision level to support the feature.

* '(All s32 output) ppmc.<port>.encoder.<channel>.count' - Encoder
   position, in counts.
* '(All s32 output) ppmc.<port>.encoder.<channel>.delta' - Change in
   counts since last read, in raw encoder count units.
* '(All float output) 'ppmc.<port>.encoder.<channel>.velocity'  -
   Velocity scaled in user units per second. On PPMC and USC this is
   derived from raw encoder counts per servo period, and hence is affected
   by encoder granularity. On UPC boards with the 8/21/09 and later
   firmware, velocity estimation by timestamping encoder counts can be
   used to improve the smoothness of this velocity output. This can be fed
   to the PID HAL component to produce a more stable servo response. This
   function has to be enabled in the HAL command line that starts the PPMC
   driver, with the timestamp=0x00 option.
* '(All float output) ppmc.<port>.encoder.<channel>.position' -
   Encoder position, in user units.
* '(All bit bidir) ppmc.<port>.encoder.<channel>.index-enable'  -
   Connect to axis.#.index-enable for home-to-index. This is a
   bidirectional HAL signal. Setting it to true causes the encoder
   hardware to reset the count to zero on the next encoder index pulse.
   The driver will detect this and set the signal back to false.
* '(PPMC float output) ppmc.<port>.DAC.<channel>.value' - sends a
    signed value to the 16-bit Digital to Analog Converter on the PPMC DAC16
    board commanding the analog output voltage of that DAC channel.
* '(UPC bit input) ppmc.<port>.pwm.<channel>.enable' - Enables a
   PWM generator.
* '(UPC float input) ppmc.<port>.pwm.<channel>.value'  - Value
   which determines the duty cycle of the PWM waveforms. The
   value is divided by 'pwm.<channel>.scale', and if the result is 0.6
   the duty cycle will be 60%, and so on. 
   Negative values result in the duty cycle being based on the absolute
   value, and the direction pin is set to indicate negative.
* '(USC bit input) ppmc.<port>.stepgen.<channel>.enable' -
   Enables a step pulse generator.
* '(USC float input) ppmc.<port>.stepgen.<channel>.velocity'  -
   Value which determines the step frequency. The value is multiplied
   by 'stepgen.<channel>.scale' , and the result is the frequency in
   steps per second. Negative values
   result in the frequency being based on the absolute value, and the
   direction pin is set to indicate negative.
* '(All bit output) ppmc.<port>.din.<channel>.in' - State of digital
   input pin, see canonical digital input.
* '(All bit output) ppmc.<port>.din.<channel>.in-not' - Inverted
   state of digital input pin, see canonical digital input.
* '(All bit input) ppmc.<port>.dout.<channel>.out'  - Value to be
   written to digital output, see canonical digital output. 
* '(Option float input) ppmc.<port>.DAC8-<channel>.value'  - Value to
   be written to analog output, range from 0 to 255. This
   sends 8 output bits to J8, which should have a Spindle DAC board
   connected to it. 0 corresponds to zero Volts, 255 corresponds to 10
   Volts. The polarity of the output can be set for always minus, always
   plus, or can be controlled by the state of SSR1 (plus when on) and SSR2
   (minus when on). You must specify extradac = 0x00 on the HAL command
   line that loads the PPMC driver to enable this function on the first
   USC ur UPC board.
* '(Option bit input) ppmc.<port>.dout.<channel>.out'  - Value to be
   written to one of the 8 extra digital output pins on
   J8. You must specify extradout = 0x00 on the HAL command line that
   loads the ppmc driver to enable this function on the first USC or UPC
   board. extradac and extradout are mutually exclusive features as they
   use the same signal lines for different purposes.  These output pins
   will be enumerated after the standard digital outputs of the board.

   blocks of contiguous registers to be read in a block to 
   minimize CPU overhead. 
* '(All funct) ppmc.<port>.write' - Writes all outputs (digital
   outputs, stepgens, PWMs) on one port.
