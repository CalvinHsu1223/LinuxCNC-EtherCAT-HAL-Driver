This is a userspace HAL program for the GS2 series of VFD's at
Automation Direct.

This component is loaded using the halcmd "loadusr" command:
----
loadusr -Wn spindle-vfd gs2_vfd -n spindle-vfd 
----

The above command says: loadusr, wait for named to load, 
component gs2_vfd, named spindle-vfd

== Command Line Options

* '-b or --bits <n>' (default 8) Set number of data bits to <n>, where n
   must be from 5 to 8 inclusive 
* '-d or --device <path>' (default /dev/ttyS0) Set the name of the serial
   device node to use 
* '-g or --debug' Turn on debugging messages. This will also set the
   verbose flag. Debug mode will cause all modbus messages to be printed
   in hex on the terminal. 
* '-n or --name <string>' (default gs2_vfd) Set the name of the HAL
   module. The HAL comp name will be set to <string>, and all pin and
   parameter names will begin with <string>. 
* '-p or --parity {even,odd,none}' (default odd) Set serial parity to
   even, odd, or none. 
* '-r or --rate <n>' (default 38400) Set baud rate to <n>. It is an error
   if the rate is not one of the following: 110, 300, 600, 1200, 2400,
   4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200 
* '-s or --stopbits {1,2}' (default 1) Set serial stop bits to 1 or 2
* '-t or --target <n>' (default 1) Set MODBUS target (slave) number. This
   must match the device number you set on the GS2. 
* '-v or --verbose' Turn on debug messages.

[NOTE]
That if there are serial configuration errors, turning on verbose
may result in a flood of timeout errors.

== Pins

Where <n> is gs2_vfd or the name given during loading with the -n option.

* '<n>.DC-bus-volts' (float, out) The DC bus voltage of the VFD
* '<n>.at-speed' (bit, out) when drive is at commanded speed
* '<n>.err-reset' (bit, in) reset errors sent to VFD
* '<n>.firmware-revision' (s32, out) from the VFD
* '<n>.frequency-command' (float, out) from the VFD
* '<n>.frequency-out' (float, out) from the VFD
* '<n>.is-stopped' (bit, out) when the VFD reports 0 Hz output
* '<n>.load-percentage' (float, out) from the VFD
* '<n>.motor-RPM' (float, out) from the VFD
* '<n>.output-current' (float, out) from the VFD
* '<n>.output-voltage' (float, out) from the VFD
* '<n>.power-factor' (float, out) from the VFD
* '<n>.scale-frequency' (float, out) from the VFD
* '<n>.speed-command' (float, in) speed sent to VFD in RPM 
    It is an error to send a speed faster than the Motor Max RPM as set in
   the VFD
* '<n>.spindle-fwd' (bit, in) 1 for FWD and 0 for REV sent to VFD
* '<n>.spindle-rev' (bit, in) 1 for REV and 0 if off
* '<n>.spindle-on' (bit, in) 1 for ON and 0 for OFF sent to VFD
* '<n>.status-1' (s32, out) Drive Status of the VFD (see the GS2 manual)
* '<n>.status-2' (s32, out) Drive Status of the VFD (see the GS2
   manual) 

[NOTE]
The status value is a sum of all the bits that are on. So a 163
which means the drive is in the run mode is the sum of 3 (run) + 32
(freq set by serial) + 128 (operation set by serial).

== Parameters

Where <n> is gs2_vfd or the name given during loading with the -n option.

* '<n>.error-count' (s32, RW) 
* '<n>.loop-time' (float, RW) how often the modbus is polled (default 0.1)
* '<n>.nameplate-HZ' (float, RW) Nameplate Hz of motor (default 60)
* '<n>.nameplate-RPM' (float, RW) Nameplate RPM of motor (default 1730)
* '<n>.retval' (s32, RW) the return value of an error in HAL
* '<n>.tolerance' (s32, RW) speed tolerance (default 0.01)
