== HAL Commands [[sec:Hal-Commands]]

More detailed information can be found in the man page for halcmd 'man
halcmd' in a terminal window. To see the HAL configuration and check
the status of pins and parameters use the HAL Configuration window on
the Machine menu in AXIS. To watch a pin status open the Watch tab and
click on each pin you wish to watch and it will be added to the watch
window.

=== loadrt [[sub:loadrt]] (((loadrt)))

The command 'loadrt' loads a real time HAL component. Real time
component functions need to be added to a thread to be updated at the
rate of the thread. You cannot load a user space component into the
real time space.

The syntax and an example:

----
loadrt <component> <options>

loadrt mux4 count=1
----


=== addf [[sub:addf]] (((addf)))

The command 'addf' adds a real time component function to a thread.
You have to add a function from a HAL real time component to a thread
to get the function to update at the rate of the thread.

If you used the Stepper Config Wizard to generate your config you will
have two threads.

 - base-thread (the high-speed thread): this thread handles items that
   need a fast response, like making step pulses, and reading and writing
   the parallel port.
 - servo-thread (the slow-speed thread): this thread handles items that
   can tolerate a slower response, like the motion controller,
   ClassicLadder, and the motion command handler.

The syntax and an example:

----
addf <component> <thread>

addf mux4 servo-thread
----

=== loadusr [[sub:loadusr]] (((loadusr)))

The command 'loadusr' loads a user space HAL component. User space
programs are their own separate processes, which optionally talk to
other HAL components via pins and parameters. You cannot load real time
components into user space.

Flags may be one or more of the following:

[horizontal]
-W:: to wait for the component to become ready. The component is assumed to
    have the same name as the first argument of the command.

-WnÂ <name>:: to wait for the component, which will have the given <name>.
    This only applies if the component has a name option.

-w:: to wait for the program to exit

-i:: to ignore the program return value (with -w)

-n:: name a component when it is a valid option for that component.

The syntax and examples:

----
loadusr <component> <options>

loadusr halui

loadusr -Wn spindle gs2_vfd -n spindle
----

In English it means 'loadusr wait for name spindle component gs2_vfd name spindle'.

=== net [[sub:net]] (((net)))

The command 'net' creates a 'connection' between a signal and and one
or more pins. If the signal does not exist net creates the new signal.
This replaces the need to use the command newsig. The optional direction
indicators '<=' and '=>' are only to make it easier for humans to follow
the logic and are not used by the net command.

The syntax and an example:

----
net <signal-name> <pin-name> <opt-direction> <opt-pin-name>

net both-home-y <= parport.0.pin-11-in
----

Each signal can only have one source (a HAL 'Dir out' pin) and as many
readers (a HAL 'Dir in' pin) as you like. In the Dir column of the HAL
Configuration window you can see which pins are 'in' and which are
'out'. The following figure shows the 'direction' of the signal from
the source, through the signal, and then out to the reader(s).

.Signal Direction[[cap:Signal-Direction]]

image::images/signal-direction.png[align="center"]

This example shows the signal xStep with the source being
stepgen.0.out and with two readers, parport.0.pin-02-out and
parport.0.pin-08-out. Basically the value of stepgen.0.out is sent to
the signal xStep and that value is then sent to parport.0.pin-02-out
and parport.0.pin-08-out.

----
    signal    source            destination          destination 
net xStep stepgen.0.out => parport.0.pin-02-out parport.0.pin-08-out
----

Since the signal xStep contains the value of stepgen.0.out (the
source) you can use the same signal again to send the value to another
reader. To do this just use the signal with the readers on another
line.

----
net xStep => parport.0.pin-02-out
----

.I/O pins
An I/O pin like encoder.N.index-enable can be read or set as allowed by the component.


=== setp [[sub:setp]] (((setp)))

The command 'setp' sets the value of a pin or parameter. The valid
values will depend on the type of the pin or parameter. It is an error
if the data types do not match.

Some components have parameters that need to be set before use.
Parameters can be set before use or while running as needed. You cannot
use setp on a pin that is connected to a signal.

The syntax and an example:

----
setp <pin/parameter-name> <value>

setp parport.0.pin-08-out TRUE
----

=== unlinkp

The command 'unlinkp' unlinks a pin from the connected signal. If no
signal was connected to the pin prior running the command, nothing
happens. The 'unlinkp' command is useful for trouble shooting.

The syntax and an example:

----
unlinkp <pin-name>

unlinkp parport.0.pin-02-out
----

=== Obsolete Commands

The following commands are depreciated and may be removed from future
versions. Any new configuration should use the <<sub:net,'net'>>> command.
These commands are included so older configurations will still work.

==== linksp

The command 'linksp' creates a 'connection' between a signal and one
pin.

The syntax and an example:

----
linksp <signal-name> <pin-name>
linksp X-step parport.0.pin-02-out
----

The 'linksp' command has been superseded by the 'net' command.

==== linkps

The command 'linkps' creates a 'connection' between one pin and one
signal. It is the same as linksp but the arguments are reversed.

The syntax and an example:

----
linkps <pin-name> <signal-name>

linkps parport.0.pin-02-out X-Step
----

The 'linkps' command has been superseded by the 'net' command.

==== newsig

the command 'newsig' creates a new HAL signal by the name <signame>
and the data type of <type>. Type must be 'bit', 's32', 'u32' or
'float'. Error if <signame> all ready exists.

The syntax and an example:

----
newsig <signame> <type>

newsig Xstep bit
----

More information can be found in the HAL manual or the man pages for
halrun.


== HAL Data [[sec:Hal-Data]]

=== Bit (((Bit)))

A bit value is an on or off.

 - bit values = true or 1 and false or 0 (True, TRUE, true are all valid)

=== Float (((Float)))

A 'float' is a floating point number. In other words the decimal point
can move as needed.

 - float values = a 32 bit floating point value, with approximately 24
   bits of resolution and over 200 bits of dynamic range.

For more information on floating point numbers see:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point]

=== s32 (((s32)))

An 's32' number is a whole number that can have a negative or positive
value.

 - s32 values = integer numbers -2147483648 to 2147483647

=== u32 (((u32)))

A 'u32' number is a whole number that is positive only.

 - u32 values = integer numbers 0 to 4294967295

== HAL Files

If you used the Stepper Config Wizard to generate your config you will
have up to three HAL files in your config directory.

 -  my-mill.hal (if your config is named 'my-mill') This file is loaded
   first and should not be changed if you used the Stepper Config Wizard.
 -  custom.hal This file is loaded next and before the GUI loads. This is
   where you put your custom HAL commands that you want loaded before the
   GUI is loaded. 
 -  custom_postgui.hal This file is loaded after the GUI loads. This is
   where you put your custom HAL commands that you want loaded after the
   GUI is loaded. Any HAL commands that use pyVCP widgets need to be
   placed here.

== HAL Components

Two parameters are automatically added to each HAL component when it
is created. These parameters allow you to scope the execution time of a
component.

+.time+(((time)))

+.tmax+(((tmax)))


Time is the number of CPU cycles it took to execute the function.

Tmax is the maximum number of CPU cycles it took to execute the
function. Tmax is a read/write parameter so the user can set it to 0 to
get rid of the first time initialization on the function's execution
time.

== Logic Components

HAL contains several real time logic components. Logic components
follow a 'Truth Table' that states what the output is for any given
input. Typically these are bit manipulators and follow electrical logic
gate truth tables.

=== and2

The 'and2' component is a two input 'and' gate. The truth table below
shows the output based on each combination of input.

Syntax

----
and2 [count=N] | [names=name1[,name2...]]
----

Functions

and2.n

Pins

    and2.N.in0 (bit, in)
    and2.N.in1 (bit, in)
    and2.N.out (bit, out)

Truth Table

[width="90%", options="header"]
|========================================
|in0 | in1 | out
|False | False | False
|True | False | False
|False | True | False
|True | True | True
|========================================

=== not

The 'not' component is a bit inverter.

Syntax

----
not [count=n] | [names=name1[,name2...]]
----

Functions

    not.all
    not.n

Pins

    not.n.in (bit, in)
    not.n.out (bit, out)

Truth Table

[width="90%", options="header"]
|========================================
|in | out
|True | False
|False | True
|========================================

=== or2

The 'or2' component is a two input OR gate.

Syntax

----
or2[count=n] | [names=name1[,name2...]]
----

Functions

+or2.n+

Pins

    or2.n.in0 (bit, in)
    or2.n.in1 (bit, in)
    or2.n.out (bit, out)

Truth Table

[width="90%", options="header"]
|========================================
|in0 | in1 | out
|True | False | True
|True | True | True
|False | True | True
|False | False | False
|========================================

=== xor2

The 'xor2' component is a two input XOR (exclusive OR)gate.

Syntax

----
xor2[count=n] | [names=name1[,name2...]]
----

Functions

+xor2.n+ 

Pins

    xor2.n.in0 (bit, in)
    xor2.n.in1 (bit, in)
    xor2.n.out (bit, out)

Truth Table

[width="90%", options="header"]
|========================================
|in0 | in1 | out
|True | False | True
|True | True | False
|False | True | True
|False | False | False
|========================================

=== Logic Examples

An 'and2' example connecting two inputs to one output.

----
loadrt and2 count=1

addf and2.0 servo-thread

net my-sigin1 and2.0.in0 <= parport.0.pin-11-in

net my-sigin2 and2.0.in1 <= parport.0.pin-12-in

net both-on parport.0.pin-14-out <= and2.0.out
----

In the above example one copy of and2 is loaded into real time space
and added to the servo thread. Next pin 11 of the parallel port is
connected to the in0 bit of the and gate. Next pin 12 is connected to
the in1 bit of the and gate. Last we connect the and2 out bit to the
parallel port pin 14. So following the truth table for and2 if pin 11
and pin 12 are on then the output pin 14 will be on.

== Conversion Components

=== weighted_sum

The weighted_sum converts a group of bits to an integer. The
conversion is the sum of the 'weights' of the bits that are on plus any
offset. The weight of the m-th bit is 2^m. This is similar to a binary
coded decimal but with more options. The 'hold' bit stops processing the
input changes so the 'sum' will not change.

The following syntax is used to load the weighted_sum component.

----
loadrt weighted_sum wsum_sizes=size[,size,...]
----

Creates weighted sum groups each with the given number of input bits
(size).

To update the weighted_sum you need to attach process_wsums to a thread.

----
addf process_wsums servo-thread
----

This updates the weighted_sum component.

In the following example clipped from the HAL Configuration window in
Axis the bits '0' and '2' are true and there is no offset. The 'weight'
of 0 is 1 and the 'weight' of 2 is 4 so the sum is 5.

.weighted_sum
