.TH LinuxCNC "1"  "2006-02-20" "LinuxCNC Documentation" "The Enhanced Machine Controller"
.SH NAME
linuxcnc \- LinuxCNC (The Enhanced Machine Controller)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B linuxcnc
[\fI-v\fR] [\fI-d\fR] [\fIINIFILE\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlinuxcnc\fR is used to start LinuxCNC (The Enhanced Machine Controller). It
starts the realtime system and then initializes a number of LinuxCNC
components (IO, Motion, GUI, HAL, etc).  The most important parameter
is \fIINIFILE\fR, which specifies the configuration name you would like
to run. If \fIINIFILE\fR is not specified, the \fBlinuxcnc\fR script presents
a graphical wizard to let you choose one.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-v\fR 
Be a little bit verbose. This causes the script to print information
as it works.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Print lots of debug information. All executed commands
are echoed to the screen. This mode is useful when something is
not working as it should.
.TP
\fBINIFILE\fR
The ini file is the main piece of an LinuxCNC configuration. It is not the
entire configuration; there are various other files that go with it
(NML files, HAL files, TBL files, VAR files). It is, however, the most
important one, because it is the file that holds the configuration
together. It can adjust a lot of parameters itself, but it also tells
\fBlinuxcnc\fR which other files to load and use.

There are several ways to specify which config to use:

Specify the absolute path to an ini, e.g.
.br
\fBlinuxcnc\fR \fI/usr/local/linuxcnc/configs/sim/sim.ini\fR

Specify a relative path from the current directory, e.g.
.br
\fBlinuxcnc\fR \fIconfigs/sim/sim.ini\fR

Otherwise, in the case where the \fBINIFILE\fR is not specified,
the behavior will depend on whether you configured linuxcnc with
\fB--enable-run-in-place\fR.  If so, the linuxcnc config chooser will search
only the configs directory in your source tree.  If not (or if you are
using a packaged version of linuxcnc), it may search several directories.
The config chooser is currently set to search the path:

.nf
\fB@LINUXCNC_CONFIG_PATH@\fR

.SH EXAMPLES
    
\fBlinuxcnc\fR

\fBlinuxcnc\fR \fIconfigs/sim/sim.ini\fR

\fBlinuxcnc\fR \fI/etc/linuxcnc/sample-configs/stepper/stepper_mm.ini\fR

.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBhalcmd(1)\fR

Much more information about LinuxCNC and HAL is available in the LinuxCNC
and HAL User Manuals, found at /usr/share/doc/linuxcnc/.
